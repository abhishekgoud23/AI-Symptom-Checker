Aase syndrome,Aase syndrome is a rare disorder that involves anemia and certain joint and skeletal deformities.,"Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins). This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.",Symptoms may include: Absent or small knuckles Cleft palate Deformed ears Droopy eyelids Inability to fully extend the joints from birth Narrow shoulders Pale skin Triple-jointed thumbs,,"Aase-Smith syndrome; Hypoplastic anemia - triphalangeal thumbs, Aase-Smith type; Diamond-Blackfan with AS-II; Aase-Smith I syndrome; Hydrocephalus-cleft palate-joint contractures syndrome"

Bleeding may be heavier or lighter than usual and occur often or randomly.,"Every woman's menstrual cycle is different. On average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days. Menstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days. Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart. Women in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease. For most women, female hormone levels change every month. The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released. AUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal. AUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women. Women who are overweight also may be more likely to have AUB. In many women, AUB is caused by a hormone imbalance.

ABO incompatibility,"A, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood types. The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells.","The different blood types are: Type A Type B Type AB Type O People who have one blood type may form proteins ( antibodies ) that cause their immune system to react against one or more of the other blood types. Being exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction. For example: People with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood. People with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood. People with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood. People with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood. Type O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood. Both blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction. Usually, a reaction occurs because of a clerical error causing someone to receive incompatible blood.",The following are symptoms of ABO incompatible transfusion reactions : Low back pain Blood in urine Chills Feeling of impending doom Fever Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Increased heart rate Pain at infusion site Chest pain Dizziness Bronchospasm (spasm of the muscles lining the lung; causes cough) Yellow skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ) Acute kidney failure Low blood pressure Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),,Transfusion reaction - hemolytic; Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction; AHTR; Blood incompatibility - ABO

Abscess,"An abscess is a collection of pus in any part of the body. In most cases, the area around an abscess is swollen and inflamed.","Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight and contain it. White blood cells (WBCs) move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances. Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances. Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not be seen, but they may cause organ damage.

Absence seizure,An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) change in awareness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.,"Seizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may also occur with other types of seizures, such as bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks ( myoclonus ), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures).","Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: Occur many times a day Occur for weeks to months before being noticed Interfere with school and learning Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: Stop walking and start again a few seconds later Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: Wide awake Thinking clearly Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling , fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing Changes in alertness (consciousness) , such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer.

Absent menstrual periods - primary,Absence of a woman's monthly menstrual period is called amenorrhea.,"Most girls begin their periods between ages 9 and 18. The average is around 12 years old. If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty. Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include: Blockages or narrowing of the cervix Hymen that has no opening Missing uterus or vagina Vaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections) Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when: Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced. The ovaries are not working correctly. Either of these problems may be due to: Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI) Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease Genetic defects or disorders Infections that occurred before or after the woman's birth Other birth defects Poor nutrition Tumors In many cases, the cause of primary amenorrhea is not known.",A female with amenorrhea will have no menstrual flow.

Absent menstrual periods - secondary,Absence of a woman's monthly menstrual period is called amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is when a woman who has been having normal menstrual cycles stops getting her periods for 6 months or longer.,"Secondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes. Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months. You are more likely to have absent periods if you: Are obese Exercise too much and for long periods of time Have low body fat (less than 15% to 17%) Have severe anxiety or emotional distress Lose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, from strict or extreme diets or after gastric bypass surgery ) Other causes include: Drugs for cancer treatment Medicines to treat schizophrenia or psychosis Overactive thyroid gland Pituitary tumors Polycystic ovarian syndrome Reduced function of the ovaries Premature ovarian failure Also, procedures such as a dilation and curettage ( D and C ) can cause scar tissue to form. This tissue may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome . Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections.","In addition to having no menstrual periods, other symptoms can include: Breast size changes Weight gain or weight loss Discharge from the breast or change in breast size Acne and increased hair growth in a male pattern Vaginal dryness Voice changes If amenorrhea is caused by a pituitary tumor, there may be other symptoms related to the tumor, such as vision loss and headache .",,Amenorrhea - secondary; No periods - secondary; Absent periods - secondary; Absent menses - secondary; Absence of periods - secondary
Absent pulmonary valve,"Absent pulmonary valve is a rare defect in which the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed. Oxygen-poor blood flows through this valve from the heart to the lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen. This condition is present at birth (congenital).","Absent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called tetralogy of Fallot . It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot. When the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen. In most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart ( ventricular septal defect ). This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body. The skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen. Absent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi). This causes breathing problems. Other heart defects that can occur with absent pulmonary valve include: Abnormal tricuspid valve Atrial septal defect Double outlet right ventricle Ductus arteriosis Endocardial cushion defect Marfan syndrome Tricuspid atresia Absent left pulmonary artery Heart problems that occur with absent pulmonary valve may be due to defects in certain genes.","Symptoms can vary depending on which other defects the infant has, but may include: Blue coloring to the skin (cyanosis) Coughing Failure to thrive Poor appetite Rapid breathing Respiratory failure Wheezing",,Absent pulmonary valve syndrome; Congenital absence of the pulmonary valve; Pulmonary valve agenesis; Cyanotic heart disease - pulmonary valve; Congenital heart disease - pulmonary valve; Birth defect heart - pulmonary valve

Achalasia,The tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is the esophagus or food pipe. Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach.,"There is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent. This problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus. Other problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes Chagas disease , which is more common in Mexico and Central and South America. Achalasia is rare. It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60. In some people, the problem may be inherited.","Symptoms include: Backflow (regurgitation) of food Chest pain , which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms Cough Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids Heartburn Unintentional weight loss",,Esophageal achalasia; Swallowing problems for liquids and solids; Cardiospasm - lower esophageal sphincter spasm
Achilles tendinitis,"Achilles tendinitis occurs when the tendon that connects the back of your leg to your heel becomes swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot. This tendon is called the Achilles tendon. It allows you to push your foot down. You use your Achilles tendon when walking, running, and jumping.","There are two large muscles in the calf. These create the power needed to push off with the foot or go up on the toes. The large Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel. Heel pain is most often due to overuse of the foot. Rarely, it is caused by an injury. Tendinitis due to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes. Achilles tendinitis may be more likely to occur if: There is a sudden increase in the amount or intensity of an activity. Your calf muscles are very tight (not stretched out). You run on hard surfaces, such as concrete. You run too often. You jump a lot (such as when playing basketball). You do not wear shoes that give your feet proper support. Your foot suddenly turns in or out. Tendinitis from arthritis is more common in middle-aged and older adults. A bone spur or growth may form in the back of the heel bone. This may irritate the Achilles tendon and cause pain and swelling. Flat feet will put more tension on the tendon.",Symptoms include pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running. The area may feel painful and stiff in the morning. The tendon may be painful to touch or move. The area may be swollen and warm. You may have trouble standing up on your toes. You may also have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably due to pain in the back of your heel.,,Tendinitis of the heel; Heel pain - Achilles

Achondrogenesis,Achondrogenesis is a rare type of growth hormone deficiency in which there is a defect in the development of bone and cartilage.,"Achondrogenesis is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. Some types are known to be recessive, meaning both parents carry the defective gene but are not affected by this condition. The chance for a subsequent child to be affected is 25%.","Symptoms may include: Very short trunk, arms, legs, and neck Head appears large in relation to the trunk Small lower jaw Narrow chest",,
Achondroplasia,Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that causes the most common type of dwarfism.,"Achondroplasia is one of a group of conditions called chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias. These rare genetic disorders cause problems with the development of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue. Achondroplasia is caused by a change (mutation) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This prevents bone growth and mainly affects the long bones in the arms and legs. People with achondroplasia have a short stature, with an average height under 4 feet 6 inches (137 centimeters). Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that if a child gets the defective gene from one parent, the child will have the disorder. If one parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chance of being affected increases to 75%. However, most cases (about 80%) appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that two parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition.",Achondroplastic dwarfism results in the following: Unusually large head Large forehead and flat bridge of the nose Crowded or crooked teeth Short stature (well below the average height for a person of the same age and sex) Average size trunk with short arms and legs (especially the upper arms and thighs) Bowed legs Limited range of motion of the elbows Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis Short fingers with an extra space between the ring and middle finger (trident hand) Decreased muscle tone in infants Almost all people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence and will have a normal lifespan.

Acidosis,Acidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids. It is the opposite of alkalosis (a condition in which there is too much base in the body fluids).,"The kidneys and lungs maintain the balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Acidosis occurs when acid builds up or when bicarbonate (a base) is lost. Acidosis is classified as either respiratory or metabolic acidosis . Respiratory acidosis develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body. This type of acidosis is usually caused when the body is unable to remove enough carbon dioxide through breathing. Other names for respiratory acidosis are hypercapnic acidosis and carbon dioxide acidosis. Causes of respiratory acidosis include: Chest deformities, such as kyphosis Chest injuries Chest muscle weakness Long-term (chronic) lung disease Neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or muscular dystrophy Overuse of sedative drugs, causing decreased respiration Acute lung disease, such as severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe medical illness Metabolic acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body. It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis: Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes). Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea. Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis ). Lactic acidosis. Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol. Severe dehydration . Lactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid . Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. This can be caused by: Cancer Carbon monoxide poisoning Drinking too much alcohol Exercising vigorously for a very long time Liver failure Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production) Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemia Seizures Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs Severe asthma Compensated acidosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of acidosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal.","Metabolic acidosis symptoms depend on the underlying disease or condition. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition. Respiratory acidosis symptoms can include: Confusion Fatigue Lethargy Shortness of breath Sleepiness",,
ACL reconstruction,"ACL reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the ligament in the center of your knee.

A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements.",,,,Anterior cruciate ligament repair; Knee surgery - ACL; Knee arthroscopy - ACL
Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples or ""zits."" Whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin (such as cysts) may develop.","Acne occurs when tiny holes on the surface of the skin become clogged. These holes are called pores. Each pore opens to a follicle. A follicle contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps your skin soft. The glands can become blocked with a mixture of oil and skin cells. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. If the top of the plug is white, it is called a whitehead . It is called a blackhead if the top of the plug is dark. If bacteria become trapped in the plug, the body's immune system may react to it, causing pimples. Acne that is deep in your skin can cause hard, painful cysts . This is called nodulocystic acne. Acne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne, even babies. The problem tends to run in families. Some things that may trigger acne include: Hormonal changes that make the skin oilier. These may be related to puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills , or stress. Greasy or oily cosmetic and hair products. Certain drugs (such as steroids, testosterone , estrogen, and phenytoin). Birth control devices, such as some drug-containing IUDs, can make acne worse. Heavy sweating and humidity. Excessively touching, resting on, or rubbing the skin. Research does not show that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne. However, diets high in refined sugars or dairy products may be related to acne in some people, but this connection is controversial.","Acne commonly appears on the face and shoulders. It may also occur on the trunk, arms, legs, and buttocks.

Acrodysostosis,"Acrodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It leads to problems with the bones of the hands, feet, and nose, and intellectual disability.","Most people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing the disorder to their children. There is a slightly greater risk with fathers who are older.","Symptoms of this disorder include: Frequent middle ear infections Growth problems, short arms and legs Hearing problems Intellectual disability The body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normal Distinct facial features",,Arkless-Graham; Acrodysplasia; Maroteaux-Malamut
Acromegaly,Acromegaly is a condition in which there is too much growth hormone (GH) in your body.,"Acromegaly is a rare condition. It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland attached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH. Usually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited. In children, too much GH causes gigantism rather than acromegaly.","Symptoms of acromegaly may include any of the following: Body odor Blood in the stool Carpal tunnel syndrome Decreased muscle strength ( weakness ) Decreased peripheral vision Dental problems, gaps between the teeth Easy fatigue Enlarged tongue Excessive height (when excess GH production begins in childhood) Excessive sweating Headache Heart enlargement, which can cause fainting or shortness of breath Hoarseness Jaw pain Joint pain , limited joint movement, swelling of the bony areas around a joint Large bones of the face, large jaw and tongue, widely spaced teeth Large feet (change in shoe size), large hands (change in ring or glove size) Large glands in the skin (sebaceous glands) causing oily skin, thickening of the skin, skin tags (growths) Sleep apnea Widened fingers or toes, with swelling, redness, and pain Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Colon polyps Excess hair growth in females ( hirsutism ) High blood pressure Type 2 diabetes Thyroid enlargement Weight gain",,Somatotroph adenoma; Growth hormone excess; Growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma; Pituitary giant (in childhood)

Actinomycosis,Actinomycosis is a long-term (chronic) bacterial infection that commonly affects the face and neck.,"Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium called Actinomyces israelii . This is a common organism found in the nose and throat. It normally does not cause disease. Because of the bacteria's normal location in the nose and throat, actinomycosis most commonly affects the face and neck. The infection can sometimes occur in the chest ( pulmonary actinomycosis ), abdomen, pelvis, or other areas of the body. The infection is not contagious. This means it does not spread to other people. Symptoms occur when the bacteria enter the tissues of the face after trauma, surgery, or infection. Common triggers include dental abscess or oral surgery. The infection can also affect certain women who have had an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Once in the tissue, the bacteria cause an abscess, producing a hard, red to reddish-purple lump, often on the jaw, from which comes the condition's common name, ""lumpy jaw."" Eventually, the abscess breaks through the skin surface to produce a draining sinus tract.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Draining sores in the skin, especially on the chest wall from lung infection with Actinomyces Fever Mild or no pain Swelling or a hard, red to reddish-purple lump on the face or upper neck Weight loss",,Lumpy jaw
Acute,"Acute means sudden. Acute symptoms appear, change, or worsen rapidly. It is the opposite of chronic.",,,,
Acute adrenal crisis,Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when there is not enough cortisol. This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands.,"The adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion called the cortex, and an inner portion called the medulla. The cortex produces 3 hormones: Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress. Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance. Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive. The medulla produces the hormone adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Both cortisol and adrenaline are released in response to stress . Cortisol production is regulated by the pituitary. This is a small gland just underneath the brain. The pituitary releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This is a hormone that causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol. Adrenaline production is regulated by nerves coming from the brain and spinal cord and by circulating hormones. Adrenal crisis can occur from any of the following: The adrenal gland is damaged due to, for example, Addison disease or other adrenal gland disease, or surgery The pituitary is injured and cannot release ACTH ( hypopituitarism ) Adrenal insufficiency is not properly treated You've been taking glucocorticoid medicines for a long time, and suddenly stop You've become very dehydrated Infection or other physical stress","Symptoms and signs of adrenal crisis can include any of the following: Abdominal pain or flank pain Confusion , loss of consciousness, or coma Dehydration Dizziness or lightheadedness Fatigue, severe weakness Headache High fever Loss of appetite Low blood pressure Low blood sugar Nausea, vomiting Rapid heart rate Rapid respiratory rate Slow, sluggish movement Unusual and excessive sweating on face or palms",,Adrenal crisis; Addisonian crisis; Acute adrenal insufficiency
Acute arterial occlusion - kidney,"Acute arterial occlusion of the kidney is a sudden, severe blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney.","The kidneys need a good blood supply. The main artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Reduced blood flow through the renal artery can hurt kidney function. A complete blockage of blood flow to the kidney can often result in permanent kidney failure. Acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery can occur after injury or trauma to the abdomen, side, or back. Blood clots that travel through the bloodstream ( emboli ) can lodge in the renal artery. Pieces of plaque from the walls of the arteries can come loose (on their own or during a medical procedure that affects an artery). This debris can block the main kidney artery or one of the smaller vessels. The risk of renal artery blockages increases in people who have certain heart disorders, which make them likely to form blood clots. These include mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation . A narrowing of the renal artery is called renal artery stenosis . This condition increases the risk of a sudden blockage.","You may not have symptoms when one kidney does not function because the second kidney can filter the blood. However, high blood pressure (hypertension) may come on suddenly and be difficult to control. If your other kidney is not working fully, blockage of the renal artery may cause symptoms of acute kidney failure . Other symptoms of acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery include: Abdominal pain Abrupt decrease in urine output Back pain Blood in the urine Flank pain or pain in the side Symptoms of high blood pressure such as headache, change in vision, and swelling Note: There may be no pain. Pain, if it is present, most often develops suddenly.",,Acute renal arterial thrombosis; Renal artery embolism; Acute renal artery occlusion; Embolism - renal artery
Acute bronchitis,"Acute bronchitis is swelling and inflamed tissue in the bronchi, the main passages that carry air to the lungs. This swelling narrows the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Other symptoms of bronchitis are a cough and coughing up mucus. Acute means the symptoms have been present only for a short time.","When acute bronchitis occurs, it almost always comes after having a cold or flu-like illness. The bronchitis infection is usually caused by a virus. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then it spreads to the airways that lead to your lungs. Sometimes, bacteria also infect your airways. This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition. To be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, you must have a cough with mucus on most days for at least 3 months.","Some symptoms of acute bronchitis are: Chest discomfort Cough that produces mucus -- the mucus may be clear or yellow-green Fatigue Fever -- usually low-grade Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity Wheezing , in people with asthma Even after acute bronchitis has cleared, you may have a dry, nagging cough that lasts for 1 to 4 weeks. Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have pneumonia or bronchitis. If you have pneumonia, you are more likely to have a high fever and chills, feel sicker, or feel more short of breath.",,
Acute cerebellar ataxia,"Acute cerebellar ataxia is sudden inability to coordinate muscle movement due to disease or injury to the cerebellum. This is the area in the brain that controls muscle movement. Ataxia means loss of muscle coordination, especially of the hands and legs.","Acute cerebellar ataxia in children, particularly younger than age 3, may occur several days or weeks after an illness caused by a virus. Viral infections that may cause this include chickenpox , Coxsackie disease, Epstein-Barr, echovirus , among others. Other causes of acute cerebellar ataxia include: Abscess of the cerebellum Alcohol, medicines, insecticides, and illicit drugs Bleeding into the cerebellum Multiple sclerosis Strokes of the cerebellum Vaccination Trauma to head and neck Certain diseases associated with some cancers (paraneoplastic disorders)","Ataxia may affect movement of the middle part of the body from the neck to the hip area (the trunk) or the arms and legs (limbs). When the person is sitting, the body may move side-to-side, back-to-front, or both. Then the body quickly moves back to a sitting upright position. When a person with ataxia of the arms reaches for an object, the hand may sway back and forth. Common symptoms of ataxia include: Clumsy speech pattern ( dysarthria ) Repetitive eye movements ( nystagmus ) Uncoordinated eye movements Walking problems (unsteady gait) that can lead to falls Difficulty controlling arm movements",,Cerebellar ataxia; Ataxia - acute cerebellar; Cerebellitis; Post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia; PVACA
Acute cholecystitis,Acute cholecystitis is sudden swelling and irritation of the gallbladder. It causes severe belly pain.,"The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine. Acute cholecystitis occurs when bile becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a gallstone blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection. Other causes include: Serious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetes Tumors of the gallbladder (rare) Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include: Being female Pregnancy Hormone therapy Older age Being Native American or Hispanic Obesity Losing or gaining weight rapidly Diabetes Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to long-term (chronic) cholecystitis . This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did.","The main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of your belly that usually lasts at least 30 minutes. You may feel: Sharp, cramping, or dull pain Steady pain Pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade Other symptoms that may occur include: Clay-colored stools Fever Nausea and vomiting Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice )",,Cholecystitis - acute; Gallstones - acute cholecystitis
Acute coronary syndrome,"Acute coronary syndrome is a term for a group of conditions that suddenly stop or severely reduce blood from flowing to the heart muscle. When blood cannot flow to the heart muscle, the heart muscle can become damaged. Heart attack and unstable angina are both acute coronary syndromes (ACS).","A fatty substance called plaque can build up in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, cells, and other substances. Plaque can block blood flow in two ways: It can cause an artery to become so narrow over time that it becomes blocked enough to cause symptoms. The plaque tears suddenly and a blood clot forms around it, severely narrowing or blocking the artery. Many risk factors for heart disease may lead to an ACS.","The most common symptom of ACS is chest pain. The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest. Other symptoms can include: Pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, back, or belly area Discomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching Discomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine Shortness of breath Anxiety Nausea Sweating Feeling dizzy or lightheaded Fast or irregular heartbeat Women and older people often experience these other symptoms, although chest pain is common for them as well.",,Heart attack - ACS; Myocardial infarction - ACS; MI - ACS; Acute MI - ACS; ST elevation myocardial infarction - ACS; Non ST-elevation myocardial infarction - ACS; Unstable angina - ACS; Accelerating angina - ACS; Angina - unstable-ACS; Progressive angina
Acute flaccid myelitis,Acute flaccid myelitis is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Inflammation of the gray matter in the spinal cord leads to muscle weakness and paralysis.,"AFM usually occurs after a cold, fever, or gastrointestinal illness. Different kinds of viruses may be the cause of AFM. These include: Enteroviruses (poliovirus and non-poliovirus) West Nile virus and similar viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus Adenoviruses It is unclear why certain viruses trigger AFM, or why some people develop the condition and others don't. Environmental toxins also can cause AFM. In many cases, a cause is never found.","A fever or a respiratory illness is often present before weakness and other symptoms begin. AFM symptoms often start with sudden muscle weakness and loss of reflexes in an arm or leg. Symptoms may progress rapidly over a few hours to days.

Acute mountain sickness,"Acute mountain sickness is an illness that can affect mountain climbers, hikers, skiers, or travelers at high altitudes, usually above 8000 feet (2400 meters).","Acute mountain sickness is caused by reduced air pressure and lower oxygen levels at high altitudes. The faster you climb to a high altitude, the more likely you will get acute mountain sickness. The best way to prevent altitude illness is to ascend gradually. It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters). Above this point ascend very slowly so that the elevation at which you sleep does not increase more than 990 feet to 1640 feet (300m to 500m) per night. You are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if: You live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude. You have had the illness before. You ascend quickly. You have not acclimatized appropriately to the altitude. Alcohol or other substances have interfered with acclimatization. You have medical problems involving the heart, nervous system, or lungs. If you have anemia","Your symptoms will also depend on the speed of your climb and how hard you push (exert) yourself. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. They can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart. In most cases, symptoms are mild. Symptoms of mild to moderate acute mountain sickness may include: Difficulty sleeping Dizziness or lightheadedness Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Rapid pulse (heart rate) Shortness of breath with exertion Symptoms that may occur with more severe acute mountain sickness include the following and may progress to high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema: Blue color to the skin (cyanosis) Chest tightness or congestion Confusion Cough Coughing up blood Decreased consciousness or withdrawal from social interaction Gray or pale complexion Inability to walk in a straight line, or walk at all Shortness of breath at rest",,High altitude cerebral edema; Altitude anoxia; Altitude sickness; Mountain sickness; High altitude pulmonary edema
Acute myeloid leukemia - adult,Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cancer that starts inside bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells.,"AML is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults. AML is more common in men than women. The bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. As a result, people with AML are more likely to have infections. They also have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease. Most of the time, a health care provider cannot tell you what caused AML. However, the following things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML: Blood disorders, including polycythemia vera , essential thrombocythemia , and myelodysplasia Certain chemicals (for example, benzene) Certain chemotherapy drugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances Radiation Weak immune system due to an organ transplant Problems with your genes may also cause AML to develop.",Symptoms of AML are mainly due to the effects on blood elements. Symptoms of AML may include any of the following: Bleeding from the nose Bleeding and swelling (rare) in the gums Bruising Bone pain or tenderness Fever and fatigue Heavy menstrual periods Pale skin Shortness of breath (gets worse with exercise) Weight loss,,Acute myelogenous leukemia; AML; Acute granulocytic leukemia; Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL); Leukemia - acute myeloid (AML); Leukemia - acute granulocytic; Leukemia - nonlymphocytic (ANLL)
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - children,Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells within the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that generates all blood components including white blood cells. Acute means the cancer develops quickly and myeloid refers to the type of white blood cells that become cancerous.,"In children, AML is rare. AML involves cells in the bone marrow that usually become certain types of white blood cells. These leukemia cells build up in the bone marrow and blood, leaving no space for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets to form. Because there are not enough healthy cells to do their jobs, children with AML are more likely to have: Anemia (low level of red blood cells) Increased risk for bleeding and bruising Infections Most of the time, the cause of AML is unknown. In children, some things can increase the risk of developing AML: Exposure to alcohol or tobacco smoke before birth A history of certain diseases, such as aplastic anemia Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome , neurofibromatosis , and other rare syndromes Previous use of certain chemotherapy medicines such as cyclophosphamide Past treatment with radiation therapy Having one or more risk factor does not mean your child will develop cancer. Most children who develop AML have no known risk factors.","Symptoms of AML include: Feeling weak or tired Bone or joint pain Frequent infections Easy bleeding or bruising Fever with or without an infection Night sweats Painless lumps in the neck, armpits, stomach, groin, or other parts of the body that may be blue or purple Pinpoint red spots ( petechiae ) under the skin caused by bleeding Shortness of breath Loss of appetite and eating less food",,Acute myelogenous leukemia - children; AML - children; Acute granulocytic leukemia - children; Acute myeloblastic leukemia - children; Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) - children
Acute nephritic syndrome,"Acute nephritic syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur with some disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidney, or glomerulonephritis.","Acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by an immune response triggered by an infection or other disease. Common causes in children and adolescents include: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (disorder that occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances that destroy red blood cells and cause kidney injury) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (disease that involves purple spots on the skin, joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and glomerulonephritis) IgA nephropathy (disorder in which antibodies called IgA build up in kidney tissue) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disorder that occurs after infection with certain strains of streptococcus bacteria) Common causes in adults include: Abdominal abscesses Goodpasture syndrome (also called anti-glomerular basement membrane disease in which the immune system attacks the glomerular basement membrane) Hepatitis B or C Endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves caused by a bacterial or fungal infection) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells) Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (a form of glomerulonephritis that leads to a rapid loss of kidney function) Lupus nephritis (kidney complication of systemic lupus erythematosus ) Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) Viral diseases such as mononucleosis , measles , and mumps The inflammation affects the function of the glomerulus. This is the part of the kidney that filters blood to make urine and remove waste. As a result, blood and protein appear in the urine, and excess fluid builds up in the body. Swelling of the body occurs when the blood loses a protein called albumin. Albumin keeps fluid in the blood vessels. When it is lost, fluid collects in the body tissues. Blood loss from the damaged kidney structures leads to blood in the urine.","Common symptoms of nephritic syndrome are: Blood in the urine (urine appears dark, tea-colored, or cloudy) Decreased urine output (little or no urine may be produced) Swelling of the face, eye socket, legs, arms, hands, feet, abdomen, or other areas High blood pressure Other symptoms that may occur include: Blurred vision, usually from burst blood vessels in the retina of the eye Cough containing mucus or pink, frothy material from fluid buildup in the lungs Shortness of breath, from fluid buildup in the lungs General ill feeling (malaise), drowsiness , confusion, aches and pains, headache Symptoms of acute kidney failure or long-term (chronic) kidney disease may develop.",,Glomerulonephritis - acute; Acute glomerulonephritis; Nephritis syndrome - acute
Acute pancreatitis,Acute pancreatitis is sudden swelling and inflammation of the pancreas.,"The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. It also produces chemicals called enzymes needed to digest food. Most of the time, the enzymes are active only after they reach the small intestine. If these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they can digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding, and damage to the organ and its blood vessels. This problem is called acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition. Alcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. About 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas. Gallstones are the next most common cause. When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes. The bile and enzymes ""back up"" into the pancreas and cause swelling. Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known. Other conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are: Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body) Damage to the bile ducts or pancreas during surgery High blood levels of a fat called triglycerides -- most often above 1,000 mg/dL Injury to the pancreas from an accident Other causes include: After certain procedures used to diagnose gallbladder and pancreas problems ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , ERCP) or ultrasound guided biopsy Cystic fibrosis Overactive parathyroid gland Reye syndrome Use of certain medicines (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine) Certain infections, such as mumps, that involve the pancreas","The main symptom of pancreatitis is pain felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen. The pain : May be worse within minutes after eating or drinking at first, more commonly if foods have a high fat content Becomes constant and more severe, lasting for several days May be worse when lying flat on the back May spread (radiate) to the back or below the left shoulder blade People with acute pancreatitis often look ill and have a fever, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Other symptoms that may occur with this disease include: Clay-colored stools Bloating and fullness Hiccups Indigestion Mild yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Swollen abdomen",,Gallstone pancreatitis; Pancreas - inflammation
Acute respiratory distress syndrome,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung condition that prevents enough oxygen from getting to the lungs and into the blood. Infants can also have respiratory distress syndrome.,"ARDS can be caused by any major direct or indirect injury to the lung. Common causes include: Breathing vomit into the lungs ( aspiration ) Inhaling chemicals Lung transplant Pneumonia , including COVID-19 infection Septic shock (infection throughout the body) Transfusions (multiple) Trauma Depending on the amount of oxygen in the blood and during breathing, the severity of ARDS is classified as: Mild Moderate Severe ARDS leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs (alveoli). This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream. The fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff. This decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine ( ventilator ) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube). ARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the heart, liver or kidneys . Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors for its development.","Symptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they cannot report symptoms. Symptoms can include any of the following: Shortness of breath Fast heartbeat Low blood pressure and organ failure Rapid breathing",,Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema; Increased-permeability pulmonary edema; ARDS; Acute lung injury
Acute tubular necrosis,"Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney failure. The tubules are tiny ducts in the kidneys that help filter the blood when it passes through the kidneys.","ATN is often caused by a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the kidney tissues (ischemia of the kidneys). It may also occur if the kidney cells are damaged by a poison or harmful substance. The internal structures of the kidney, particularly the tissues of the kidney tubule, become damaged or destroyed. ATN is one of the most common structural changes that can lead to acute kidney failure. ATN is a common cause of kidney failure in people who are in the hospital. Risks for ATN include: Blood transfusion reaction Injury or trauma that damages the muscles Low blood pressure (hypotension) that lasts longer than 30 minutes Recent major surgery Septic shock (serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure) Liver disease and kidney damage caused by diabetes ( diabetic nephropathy ) may make a person more prone to develop ATN. ATN can also be caused by medicines that are toxic to the kidneys. These medicines include aminoglycoside antibiotics and the antifungal drug amphotericin.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased consciousness , coma, delirium or confusion , drowsiness, and lethargy Decreased urine output or no urine output General swelling, fluid retention Nausea, vomiting",,Necrosis - renal tubular; ATN; Necrosis - acute tubular
Addison disease,Addison disease is a disorder that causes the adrenal glands to not produce enough hormones.,"The adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion, called the cortex, and an inner portion, called the medulla. The cortex produces 3 hormones: Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response , and help the body respond to stress. Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance. Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive. Addison disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex. The damage causes the cortex to produce hormone levels that are too low. This damage may be caused by the following: The immune system mistakenly attacking the adrenal glands ( autoimmune disease ) Infections such as tuberculosis , HIV , or fungal infections Hemorrhage into the adrenal glands Tumors Risk factors for the autoimmune type of Addison disease include other autoimmune diseases: Swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland that often results in reduced thyroid function ( chronic thyroiditis ) Thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone ( overactive thyroid , Graves disease ) Itchy rash with bumps and blisters ( dermatitis herpetiformis ) Parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone ( hypoparathyroidism ) Pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones ( hypopituitarism ) Autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and the muscles they control ( myasthenia gravis ) Body does not have enough healthy red blood cells ( pernicious anemia ) Testicles cannot produce sperm or male hormones ( testicular failure ) Type I diabetes Loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of the skin ( vitiligo ) Certain rare genetic defects may also cause adrenal insufficiency.","Symptoms of Addison disease may include any of the following: Abdominal pain Chronic diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting Darkening of the skin Dehydration Dizziness when standing up Low-grade fever Low blood sugar Low blood pressure, especially with a change in body position Extreme weakness , fatigue , and slow, sluggish movement Darker skin on the inside of the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa ) Salt craving (eating food with a lot of added salt) Weight loss with reduced appetite Symptoms may not be present all the time.

Adenomyosis,Adenomyosis is a thickening of the walls of the uterus. It occurs when endometrial tissue grows into the outer muscular walls of the uterus. Endometrial tissue forms the lining of the uterus.,"The cause is not known. Sometimes, adenomyosis may cause the uterus to grow in size. The condition most often occurs in women ages 35 to 50 who have had at least one pregnancy.","In many cases, there are no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include: Long-term or heavy menstrual bleeding Painful menstrual periods , which gets worse Pelvic pain during intercourse",,Endometriosis interna; Adenomyoma; Pelvic pain - adenomyosis
Adhesion,Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue that form between two surfaces inside the body and cause them to stick together.,"With movement of the body, internal organs such as the bowel or uterus are normally able to shift and to slide past each other. This is because these tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity have smooth, slippery surfaces. Inflammation (swelling), surgery, or injury can cause adhesions to form and prevent this movement. Adhesions can occur almost anywhere in the body, including: Joints, such as the shoulder Eyes Inside the abdomen or pelvis Adhesions can become larger or tighter over time. Problems may occur if the adhesions cause an organ or body part to: Twist Pull out of position Be unable to move normally The risk of forming adhesions is high after bowel or female organ surgeries. Surgery using a laparoscope is less likely to cause adhesions than open surgery. Other causes of adhesions in the abdomen or pelvis include: Appendicitis , most often when the appendix breaks open (ruptures) Cancer Endometriosis Infections in the abdomen and pelvis, such as appendicitis or fallopian tube infection Radiation treatment Adhesions around the joints may occur: After surgery or trauma With certain types of arthritis With overuse of a joint or tendon","Adhesions in joints, tendons, or ligaments make it harder to move the joint. They may also cause pain. Adhesions in the belly (abdomen) may cause a blockage of the intestines . Symptoms include: Bloating or swelling of your belly Constipation Nausea and vomiting No longer being able to pass gas Pain in the belly that is severe and crampy Adhesions in the pelvis may cause long-term (chronic) pelvic pain.",,Pelvic adhesion; Intraperitoneal adhesion; Intrauterine adhesion
Adjustment disorder,"Adjustment disorder is a group of symptoms, such as stress, anxiety, feeling sad or hopeless, and physical symptoms that can occur after you go through a stressful life event.","Many different events may trigger symptoms of an adjustment disorder.

One gland is located on top of each kidney.,"ACC is most common in children younger than 5 years old and adults in their 40s and 50s. The condition may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited). Both men and women can develop this tumor. ACC can produce the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone, as well as other hormones. In women the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics. ACC is very rare. The cause is unknown.","Symptoms of increased cortisol or other adrenal gland hormones may include: Fatty, rounded hump high on the back just below the neck ( buffalo hump ) Flushed, rounded face with pudgy cheeks ( moon face ) Obesity Stunted growth ( short stature ) Virilization -- the appearance of male characteristics, including increased body hair (especially on the face), pubic hair, acne, deepening of the voice, and enlarged clitoris (females) Symptoms of increased aldosterone are the same as symptoms of low potassium, and include: Muscle cramps Weakness Pain in the abdomen",,Tumor - adrenal; ACC - adrenal
Adrenoleukodystrophy,Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats.

Some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. Some cases of ALD occur when the gene changes on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are three major categories of disease: Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones","Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements Crossed eyes Handwriting that gets worse Difficulty at school Difficulty understanding what people are saying Hearing loss Hyperactivity Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis Seizures Swallowing difficulties Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: Difficulty controlling urination Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: Coma Decreased appetite Increased skin color Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) Muscle weakness Vomiting",,X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy; Adrenomyeloneuropathy; Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy; ALD; Schilder-Addison Complex

Agammaglobulinemia,Agammaglobulinemia is an inherited disorder in which a person has very low levels of protective immune system proteins called immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are a type of antibody. Low levels of these antibodies make you more likely to get infections.,"This is a rare disorder that mainly affects males. It is caused by a gene defect that blocks the growth of normal, mature immune cells called B lymphocytes. As a result, the body makes very little (if any) immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins play a major role in the immune response , which protects against illness and infection. People with this disorder develop infections again and again. Common infections include ones that are due to bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae , pneumococci ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ), and staphylococci. Common sites of infection include: Gastrointestinal tract Joints Lungs Skin Upper respiratory tract Agammaglobulinemia is inherited, which means other people in your family may have the condition.",Symptoms include frequent episodes of: Bronchitis (airway infection) Conjunctivitis (eye infection) Diarrhea Otitis media (middle ear infection) Pneumonia (lung infection) Sinusitis (sinus infection) Skin infections Upper respiratory tract infections Infections typically appear in the first 4 years of life.

Age-related hearing loss,"Age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, is the slow loss of hearing that occurs as people get older.","Tiny hair cells inside your inner ear help you hear. They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent. There is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older. Your genes and loud noise (for example from loud concerts or music headphones) may play a role. The following factors contribute to age-related hearing loss: Family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families) Repeated exposure to loud noises Smoking (smokers are more likely to have such hearing loss than nonsmokers) Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes Certain medicines, such as chemotherapy drugs for cancer","Loss of hearing often occurs slowly over time. Symptoms include: Difficulty hearing people around you Having to raise the volume on the TV Frequently asking people to repeat themselves Frustration at not being able to hear Certain sounds seeming overly loud Problems hearing in noisy areas Problems telling apart certain sounds, such as ""s"" or ""th"" More difficulty understanding people with higher-pitched voices Ringing in the ears Talk to your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms.",,Hearing loss - age related; Presbycusis
Age-related macular degeneration,"Macular degeneration is an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision. This makes it difficult to see fine details and read.","The retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed. It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It has a high amount of two natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin. AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula. There are two types of AMD: Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form. Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. This type of AMD causes most of the vision loss associated with the condition. Health care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older. Risk factors for AMD are: Family history of AMD Being White Cigarette smoking High-fat diet Being female","You may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision. SYMPTOMS OF DRY AMD The most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details. But you can see well enough to walk and do most daily activities. As dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker. In the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close. SYMPTOMS OF WET AMD The most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy. There may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time. With both types of AMD, central vision loss can occur quickly. If this happens, you will need to be seen right away by an ophthalmologist. Make sure this eye doctor has experience in treating problems with the retina.",,Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); AMD; Vision loss - AMD

Alcohol withdrawal,Alcohol withdrawal refers to symptoms that may occur when a person who has been drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis suddenly stops drinking alcohol.,"Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults. But it may also occur in teenagers or children. The more often you drink, the more likely you are to have alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking. You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems.","Alcohol withdrawal symptoms tend to occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms tend to peak by 24 to 72 hours, but may go on for weeks. Common symptoms include: Anxiety or nervousness Depression Fatigue Irritability Jumpiness or shakiness Mood swings Nightmares Not thinking clearly Other symptoms may include: Sweating , clammy skin Enlarged (dilated) pupils Headache Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Pallor Rapid heart rate Sweating, clammy skin Tremor of the hands or other body parts Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal.

Alcoholic liver disease,Alcoholic liver disease is damage to the liver and its function due to alcohol abuse.,"Alcoholic liver disease most often occurs after years of heavy drinking. Over time, scarring and cirrhosis can occur. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease. Alcoholic liver disease does not occur in all heavy drinkers. The chances of getting liver disease go up the longer you have been drinking and more alcohol you consume. You do not have to get drunk for the disease to happen. The disease is most common in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have this problem. However, women may develop the disease after less exposure to alcohol than men. Some people may have an inherited risk for the disease.","There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly. This depends on how well the liver is working. Symptoms tend to be worse after a period of heavy drinking. Early symptoms include: Loss of energy Poor appetite and weight loss Nausea Belly pain Small, red spider-like blood vessels on the skin As liver function worsens, symptoms may include: Fluid buildup of the legs (edema) and in the abdomen ( ascites ) Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes ( jaundice ) Redness on the palms of the hands In men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swelling Easy bruising and abnormal bleeding Confusion or problems thinking Pale or clay-colored stools Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract",,Liver disease due to alcohol; Cirrhosis or hepatitis - alcoholic; Laennec's cirrhosis
Alcoholic neuropathy,Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.,"The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.

Alkalosis,Alkalosis is a condition in which the body fluids have excess base (alkali). This is the opposite of excess acid (acidosis).,"The kidneys and lungs maintain the proper balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Decreased carbon dioxide (an acid) level or increased bicarbonate (a base) level makes the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. There are different types of alkalosis. These are described below. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by a low carbon dioxide level in the blood. This can be due to: Fever Being at a high altitude Lack of oxygen Liver disease Lung disease, which causes you to breathe faster ( hyperventilate ) Aspirin poisoning Metabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the blood. It can also occur due to certain kidney diseases. Hypochloremic alkalosis is caused by an extreme lack or loss of chloride, such as from prolonged vomiting. Hypokalemic alkalosis is caused by the kidneys' response to an extreme lack or loss of potassium. This can occur from taking certain water pills (diuretics). Compensated alkalosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of alkalosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal.","Symptoms of alkalosis can include any of the following: Confusion (can progress to stupor or coma) Hand tremor Lightheadedness Muscle twitching Nausea, vomiting Numbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet Prolonged muscle spasms (tetany)",,
Alkaptonuria,Alkaptonuria is a rare condition in which a person's urine turns a dark brownish-black color when exposed to air. Alkaptonuria is part of a group of conditions known as an inborn error of metabolism.,"A defect in the HGD gene causes alkaptonuria. The gene defect makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air. Alkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.","Urine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The disease is most often discovered in mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur. Symptoms may include: Arthritis (especially of the spine) that gets worse over time Darkening of the ear Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea",,AKU; Alkaptonuria; Homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency; Alkaptonuric ochronosis
Allergen,"An allergen is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction. In some people, the immune system recognizes allergens as foreign or dangerous. As a result, the immune system reacts by making a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE) to defend against the allergen. This reaction leads to allergy symptoms.",,,,
Allergic conjunctivitis,"The conjunctiva is a clear layer of tissue lining the eyelids and covering the white of the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes swollen or inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances.","When your eyes are exposed to allergy-causing substances, a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen. The eyes can become red, itchy , and teary very quickly. The pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny, hard-to-see pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever. Your symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground. Mold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also. Allergies tend to run in families. It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term ""allergy"" even when they might not truly be an allergy.","Symptoms may be seasonal and can include: Intense itching or burning eyes Puffy eyelids, most often in the morning Red eyes Stringy eye discharge Tearing (watery eyes) Widened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye",,Conjunctivitis - allergic seasonal/perennial; Atopic keratoconjunctivitis; Pink eye - allergic

They can be breathed into the lungs, swallowed, or injected.","Common allergens include: Animal dander Bee stings or stings from other insects such as fire ants Foods, especially milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish Medicines Pollens","Common symptoms of a mild allergic reaction include: A few hives (especially over the neck and face) Itching Nasal congestion Rashes Watery, red eyes Symptoms of a moderate or severe reaction include: Abdominal pain Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds Anxiety Chest discomfort or tightness Cough Diarrhea Difficulty breathing, wheezing Difficulty swallowing Dizziness or lightheadedness Flushing or redness of the face Hives all over Nausea or vomiting Palpitations Swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue Unconsciousness",,Anaphylaxis; Anaphylaxis - first aid
Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis is a diagnosis associated with a group of symptoms affecting the nose. These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to.","An allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an allergen such as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. Hay fever involves an allergic reaction to pollen. Plants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area. The amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not. Hot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air. On cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground. Hay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies.","Symptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include: Itchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area Problems with smell Runny nose Sneezing Watery eyes Symptoms that may develop later include: Stuffy nose (nasal congestion) Coughing Clogged ears and decreased sense of smell Sore throat Dark circles under the eyes Puffiness under the eyes Fatigue and irritability Headache",,Hay fever; Nasal allergies; Seasonal allergy; Seasonal allergic rhinitis; Allergies - allergic rhinitis; Allergy - allergic rhinitis
Allergies,An allergy is an immune response or reaction to substances that are usually not harmful.,"Allergies are very common. Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies. The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system can also react to foreign substances called allergens . These allergens are usually harmless, and in most people do not cause a problem. In a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. Watch this video about: Allergies Common allergens include: Drugs Dust Food Insect venom Mold Pet and other animal dander Pollen Some people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers. Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms. Allergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems, eczema , and asthma , worse.","Mostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example: Allergens that you breathe in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and wheezing . Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash , hives , itching, blisters, or skin peeling.

Alopecia areata,Alopecia areata is a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. It can lead to total hair loss.,"Alopecia areata is thought to be an autoimmune condition . This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy hair follicles. Some people with this condition have a family history of alopecia . Alopecia areata is seen in men, women, and children. In a few people, hair loss may occur after a major life event such as an illness, pregnancy, or trauma.","Hair loss is usually the only symptom. A few people may also feel a burning sensation or itching. Alopecia areata usually begins as one to several (1 cm to 4 cm) patches of hair loss. Hair loss is most often seen on the scalp. It may also occur in the beard, eyebrows, pubic hair, and arms or legs in some people. Nail pitting may also occur. Patches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape. They may be peach-colored. Hairs that look like exclamation points are sometimes seen at the edges of a bald patch with a magnifying tool. If alopecia areata leads to total hair loss, it often occurs within 6 months after symptoms first start.

AAT is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver. AAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic defect. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent. Adults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age. Smoking can increase the risk for emphysema and make it occur earlier.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Shortness of breath with and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD Symptoms of liver failure Loss of weight without trying Wheezing Coughing",,AAT deficiency; Alpha-1 protease deficiency; COPD - alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; Cirrhosis - alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
Alport syndrome,Alport syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that damages the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. It can also cause hearing loss and eye problems.,"Alport syndrome is an inherited form of kidney inflammation (nephritis). It is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen. The disorder is rare. There are three genetic types: X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) -- This is the most common type. The disease is more severe in males than in females. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) -- Males and females have equally severe disease. Autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease. With all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood. At first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point, dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.","The main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear. KIDNEYS Other symptoms of kidney problems include: Abnormal urine color Blood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise Flank pain High blood pressure Swelling throughout the body (edema) Fatigue Poor appetite Excessive thirst EARS Over time, Alport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults. With ARAS, boys and girls have hearing loss during childhood. With ADAS, it occurs later in life. Hearing loss usually occurs before kidney failure. EYES Alport syndrome also leads to eye problems in those with XLAS and ARAS, including: Abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as cataracts . Corneal erosion in which there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision. Abnormal coloring of the retina , a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy. It doesn't cause vision problems, but can help diagnose Alport syndrome.

Alzheimer - resources,The following organizations are good resources for information on Alzheimer disease:,,,,
Alzheimer disease,"Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior.","The exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain are associated with Alzheimer disease. This leads to structures called neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Most experts believe that this is the cause of Alzheimer disease but why this happens to some people is not known. You are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you: Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging. Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease. Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease. The following may also increase the risk: Being female Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol History of head trauma There are two types of Alzheimer disease: Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified. Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear. Watch this video about: Alzheimer disease","Alzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: Emotional behavior or personality Language Memory Perception Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Alzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of MCI include: Difficulty doing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems or making decisions Forgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include: Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior Poor performance of job duties As Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Delusions, depression , and agitation Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving Difficulty reading or writing Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness Hallucinations , arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact People with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer: Recognize family members Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease: Problems controlling bowel movements or urine Swallowing problems",,Senile dementia - Alzheimer type (SDAT); SDAT; Dementia - Alzheimer; Alzheimer's disease
Amaurosis fugax,Amaurosis fugax is a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes due to a lack of blood flow to the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball.,"Amaurosis fugax is not itself a disease. Instead, it is a sign of other disorders. Amaurosis fugax can occur from different causes. One cause is when a blood clot or a piece of plaque blocks an artery in the eye. The blood clot or plaque usually travels from a larger artery, such as the carotid artery in the neck or an artery in the heart, to an artery in the eye. Plaque is a hard substance that forms when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. Risk factors include: Heart disease, especially irregular heartbeat Alcohol abuse Cocaine use Diabetes Family history of stroke High blood pressure High cholesterol Increasing age Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for a stroke) Amaurosis fugax can also occur because of other disorders such as: Other eye problems, such as inflammation of the optic nerve ( optic neuritis ) Blood vessel disease called polyarteritis nodosa Migraine headaches Brain tumor Head injury Multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammation of the nerves due to the body's immune cells attacking the nervous system Systemic lupus erythematosus , an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune cells attack healthy tissue throughout the body","Symptoms include the sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. This usually lasts for a few seconds to several minutes. Afterward, vision returns to normal.

Ambiguous genitalia,Ambiguous genitalia is a rare condition where a child is born with outer genitals that do not clearly look either male or female. They may have features of both sexes or not be fully developed. The characteristics of the child's genitals may not match their internal sex organs or their genetic sex.,"Causes for ambiguous genitalia include: 46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) and 46,XY DSD. The genitalia are of one sex, but some physical characteristics of the other sex are present. Ovotesticular DSD. This is a very rare condition, in which tissue from both the ovaries and testicles is present. The child may have parts of both male and female genitals. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia . This condition has several forms, but the most common form causes a genetic female to appear male. Infants are tested for this potentially life-threatening condition during newborn screening exams. Chromosomal abnormalities, including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Turner syndrome (45,X). If the mother takes certain medicines (such as androgenic steroids), a genetic female may look more male. Lack of production of certain hormones can cause the embryo to develop with a female body type, regardless of genetic sex. Androgen insensitivity syndrome. Even if the body makes the hormones needed to develop into a physical male, the body does not respond normally to those hormones. This may produce female characteristics, even though the genetic sex is male.",,,Genitals - ambiguous; Uncertain genitalia; Atypical genitalia
Amblyopia,"Amblyopia is the loss of the ability to see clearly through one eye. It is also called ""lazy eye."" It is the most common cause of vision problems in children.","Amblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop during childhood. This problem develops because the abnormal eye sends the wrong image to the brain. This is the case in strabismus (crossed eyes). In other eye problems, a blurred image is sent to the brain. This confuses the brain, and the brain may learn to ignore the image from the weaker eye. Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia. Having a family member with strabismus, increases your chance of having strabismus. The term ""lazy eye"" refers to amblyopia, which often occurs along with strabismus. However, amblyopia can occur due to something other than strabismus. Also, people can have strabismus without amblyopia. Other causes include: Childhood cataracts Farsightedness , nearsightedness , or astigmatism , especially if it is greater in one eye In strabismus, the only problem with the eye itself is that it is pointed in the wrong direction. If poor vision is caused by a problem with the eyeball, such as cataracts, amblyopia will still need to be treated, even if the cataracts are removed. Amblyopia may not develop if both eyes have equally poor vision.",Symptoms of the condition include: Eyes that turn in or out Eyes that do not appear to work together Inability to judge depth correctly Poor vision in one eye,,Lazy eye; Vision loss - amblyopia
Amebiasis,Amebiasis is an infection of the intestines. It is caused by the microscopic parasite Entamoeba histolytica.,"E histolytica can live in the large intestine (colon) without causing damage to the intestine. In some cases, it invades the colon wall, causing colitis , acute dysentery, or long-term (chronic) diarrhea. The infection can also spread through the bloodstream to the liver. In rare cases, it can spread to the lungs, brain, or other organs. This condition occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas that have crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. Africa, Mexico, parts of South America, and India have major health problems due to this condition. The parasite may spread: Through food or water contaminated with stool Through fertilizer made of human waste From person to person, particularly by contact with the mouth or rectal area of an infected person Risk factors for severe amebiasis include: Alcohol use Cancer Malnutrition Older or younger age Pregnancy Recent travel to a tropical region Use of corticosteroid medicine to suppress the immune system In the United States, amebiasis is most common among those who live in institutions or people who have traveled to an area where amebiasis is common.","Most people with this infection do not have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they are seen 7 to 28 days after being exposed to the parasite. Mild symptoms may include: Abdominal cramps Diarrhea: passage of 3 to 8 semiformed stools per day, or passage of soft stools with mucus and occasional blood Fatigue Excessive gas Rectal pain while having a bowel movement ( tenesmus ) Unintentional weight loss Severe symptoms may include: Abdominal tenderness Bloody stools , including passage of liquid stools with streaks of blood, passage of 10 to 20 stools per day Fever Vomiting",,Amebic dysentery; Intestinal amebiasis; Amebic colitis; Diarrhea - amebiasis

After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver. Amebiasis spreads from eating food or water that has been contaminated with feces. This is sometimes due to the use of human waste as fertilizer. Amebiasis is also spread through person-to-person contact. The infection occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas where crowded living conditions and poor sanitation exist. Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and India have significant health problems from this disease.

The defects may affect the abdomen or chest as well as the face, arms, legs, fingers, or toes and may cause amputation.","Amniotic bands are thought to be caused by damage to a part of the placenta called the amnion (or amniotic membrane). The placenta carries blood to a baby still growing in the womb. Damage to the placenta can prevent normal growth and development. Damage to the amnion may produce fiber-like bands that can trap, compress, or amputate parts of the developing baby. These bands reduce blood supply to the areas and cause them to develop abnormally. However, some cases of ABS deformity may be caused by reduced blood supply without any signs of bands or damage to the amnion. There have also been rare cases that seem to be due to genetic defects.","The severity of the deformity can vary widely, from a small dent in a toe or finger to an entire body part missing or being severely underdeveloped. Symptoms may include: Abnormal gap in the head or face (if it goes across the face, it is called a cleft) All or part of a finger, toe, arm or leg missing (congenital amputation) Defect (cleft or hole) of the abdomen or chest wall (if band is located in those areas) Permanent band or indentation around an arm, leg, finger, or toe",,Amniotic band syndrome; Amniotic constriction bands; Constriction band syndrome; ABS; Limb-body wall complex; Constriction rings; Body wall defect

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain, brain stem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement.","One in 10 cases of ALS is due to a genetic variant. The cause is unknown in most other cases. In ALS, motor nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition continues to get worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe. ALS affects approximately 7 out of every 100,000 people worldwide. Having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins.","Symptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing. Weakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems. ALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Most people are able to think normally, although a small number develop dementia, causing problems with memory. Muscle weakness starts in one body part, such as the arm or hand, and slowly gets worse until it leads to the following: Difficulty lifting, climbing stairs, and walking Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing -- choking easily, drooling, or gagging Head drop due to weakness of the neck muscles Speech problems, such as a slow or abnormal speech pattern (slurring of words) Voice changes, hoarseness Other findings include: Depression Changing expressions of emotions (emotional lability) Muscle cramps Muscle stiffness, called spasticity Muscle contractions , called fasciculations Weight loss",,Lou Gehrig disease; ALS; Upper and lower motor neuron disease; Motor neuron disease

Anal cancer,Anal cancer is cancer that starts in the anus. The anus is the opening at the end of your rectum. The rectum is the last part of your large intestine where solid waste from food (stool) is stored. Stool leaves your body through the anus when you have a bowel movement.,"Anal cancer can start anywhere in the anus. Where it starts determines the kind of cancer it is. Squamous cell carcinoma. This is the most common type of anal cancer. It starts in cells that line the anal canal and grows into the deeper tissue. Cloacogenic carcinoma. Almost all the rest of anal cancers are tumors that start in cells lining the area between the anus and rectum. Cloacogenic carcinoma looks different than squamous cell cancers, but behaves similarly and is treated the same. Adenocarcinoma. This type of anal cancer is rare in the United States. It starts in the anal glands below the anal surface and is often more advanced when it is found. Skin cancer. Some cancers form outside the anus in the perianal area. This area is mainly skin. The tumors here are skin cancers and are treated as skin cancer. The cause of anal cancer is unclear. However, there is a link between anal cancer and the human papillomavirus or HPV infection. HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that has been linked to other cancers as well. Other major risk factors include: HIV/AIDS infection. Anal cancer is more common among HIV/AIDS positive men who have sex with other men. Sexual activity. Having many sexual partners and having anal sex are both major risks. This may be due to the increased risk for HPV and HIV/AIDS infection. Smoking. Quitting will reduce your risk for anal cancer. Weak immune system. HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, certain medicines, and other conditions that weaken the immune system increase your risk. Age. Most people who have anal cancer are age 50 or older. In rare cases, it is seen in people younger than age 35. Sex and race. Anal cancer is more common among women than men in most groups. More African American males get anal cancer than females.","Rectal bleeding, often minor, is one of the first signs of anal cancer.

Anaphylaxis,Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening type of allergic reaction.,"Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction to a chemical that has become an allergen . An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction. After being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body. Tissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms. Some medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include: Medicine allergies Food allergies Insect bites/stings Pollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause. Anaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction.","Symptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome,"Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who has one X and one Y chromosome (typically seen in males) is resistant to hormones that produce a male appearance (called androgens). As a result, the person has some of the physical traits of a female, but the genetic makeup of a male.","In the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy, all babies have the same genitals. As a baby grows inside the womb, male or female genitals develop depending on the sex chromosomes the baby has from the parents (XY for male, XX for female). It also depends on the levels of androgens. In a baby with XY chromosomes, high levels of androgens are made in the testes. This baby will develop male genitals. In a baby with XX chromosomes, there are no testes and the levels of androgens are very low. This baby will develop female genitals. AIS is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. The syndrome is divided into three main categories: Complete AIS (CAIS) Partial AIS ( PAIS ) Mild AIS (MAIS) In CAIS: The body does not respond to androgen at all. The penis and other male body parts fail to develop. The child appears female at birth. In PAIS: The body only partly responds to androgen. Infants with PAIS may have male traits, female traits, or both. In MAIS: In this mild form, the body only partly responds to androgen. Infants with MAIS will have male traits. The syndrome is passed down genetically ( X-linked recessive inheritance ). People with two X chromosomes are not affected if only one copy of the X chromosome carries the genetic variant. Males who inherit the gene from their mothers will have the condition. There is a 50% chance that a male child of a mother with the genetic trait will be affected. Every female child of a mother with the genetic trait has a 50% chance of carrying the genetic trait. Family history is important in determining risk factors of AIS.","A person with CAIS appears to be female but has no uterus, no fallopian tubes, or ovaries. They have very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics (such as breasts) develop. However, the person does not menstruate or become fertile. People with PAIS may have both male and female physical characteristics ( ambiguous genitalia ). These characteristics vary from person to person.

Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.,"Although many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. Healthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color. People with anemia do not have enough hemoglobin. The body needs certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to make enough red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid are three of the most important ones. The body may not have enough of these nutrients due to: Changes in the lining of the stomach or intestines that affect how well nutrients are absorbed (for example, celiac disease ) Poor diet Surgery that removes part of the stomach or intestines Possible causes of anemia include: Iron deficiency Vitamin B12 deficiency Folate deficiency Certain medicines Destruction of red blood cells earlier than normal (which may be caused by immune system problems) Long-term (chronic) diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cancer, ulcerative colitis , or rheumatoid arthritis Some forms of anemia, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, which can be inherited Pregnancy Problems with bone marrow such as lymphoma, leukemia , myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma , or aplastic anemia Slow blood loss (for example, from heavy menstrual periods or stomach ulcers ) Sudden heavy blood loss","You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild or if the problem develops slowly. Symptoms that may occur first include: Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise Headaches Problems concentrating or thinking Irritability Loss of appetite Numbness and tingling of hands and feet If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: Blue color to the whites of the eyes Brittle nails Desire to eat ice or other non-food things ( pica syndrome) Lightheadedness when you stand up Pale skin color Shortness of breath with mild activity or even at rest Sore or inflamed tongue Mouth ulcers Abnormal or increased menstrual bleeding",,
Anemia caused by low iron - children,Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.,"Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed. Toddlers who drink too much cow's milk may also become anemic because too much cow's milk makes it difficult for the body to absorb iron. Also, children who drink too much cow's milk may not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron. Other causes may be: The body is not able to absorb iron well, even though the child is eating enough iron. Slow blood loss over a long period, often due to menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract. Iron deficiency in children can also be related to lead poisoning .","Mild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your child may: Act irritable Become short of breath Crave unusual foods ( pica ) Eat less food Feel tired or weak all the time Have a sore tongue Have headaches or dizziness With more severe anemia, your child may have: Blue-tinged or very pale whites of eyes Brittle nails Pale skin",,Anemia - iron deficiency - children
Anemia caused by low iron - infants and toddlers,Anemia is a problem in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells bring oxygen to body tissues.,"Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed. Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old. Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron. Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it: Has less iron Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.","Mild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your infant or toddler may: Act irritable Become short of breath Crave unusual foods (called pica) Eat less food Feel tired or weak all the time Have a sore tongue Have headaches or dizziness With more severe anemia, your child may have: Blue-tinged or pale whites of eyes Brittle nails Pale skin color",,Anemia - iron deficiency - infants and toddlers
Anemia of chronic disease,Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.,"Anemia is a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells in the blood. ACD is a common cause of anemia. Some conditions that can lead to ACD include: Autoimmune disorders , such as Crohn disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , and ulcerative colitis Cancer , including lymphoma and Hodgkin disease Long-term infections, such as bacterial endocarditis , osteomyelitis (bone infection), HIV/AIDS , lung abscess, hepatitis B or hepatitis C","Anemia of chronic disease is often mild. You may not notice any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include: Feeling weak or tired Headache Paleness Shortness of breath",,Anemia of inflammation; Inflammatory anemia; AOCD; ACD; Anemia of chronic inflammation
Anencephaly,Anencephaly is the absence of a large part of the brain and the skull.,Anencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that becomes the spinal cord and brain. Anencephaly occurs early in the development of an unborn baby. It results when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close. The exact cause is not known. Possible causes include: Environmental toxins Low intake of folic acid by the mother during pregnancy The exact number of cases of anencephaly is unknown. Many of these pregnancies result in miscarriage. Having one infant with this condition increases the risk of having another child with neural tube defects.,Symptoms of anencephaly are: Absence of the skull Absence of parts of the brain Facial feature abnormalities Severe developmental delay Heart defects may be present in 1 out of 5 cases.,,Aprosencephaly with open cranium
Aneurysm,An aneurysm is an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel.,"It is often not clear exactly what causes aneurysms. Some aneurysms are present at birth (congenital). Defects in some parts of the artery wall may be a cause. Common locations for aneurysms include: Major artery from the heart such as the thoracic or abdominal aorta Brain ( cerebral aneurysm ) Behind the knee (popliteal artery aneurysm) Intestine (mesenteric artery aneurysm) Artery in the spleen (splenic artery aneurysm) Certain factors or conditions may increase the risk for aneurysms including: High blood pressure (thoracic, abdominal and cerebral aneurysms) High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Illicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine) Pregnancy (often linked to splenic artery aneurysms) Family history (sibling, parent, or child) Inherited disorders that may increase the risk include: Fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal cell growth in artery walls) Marfan syndrome Polycystic kidney disease Coarctation of the aorta Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)","The symptoms depend on where the aneurysm is located. If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen. Aneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears. If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the ""worst headache of my life."" The risk of neurologic injury, coma , or death after a rupture is high.",,Aneurysm - splenic artery; Aneurysm - popliteal artery; Aneurysm - mesenteric artery
Aneurysm in the brain,"An aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. When an aneurysm occurs in a blood vessel of the brain, it is called an intracranial aneurysm. These usually occur around or under the part of the brain called the cerebrum and, when this is true, are called a cerebral aneurysm.","Aneurysms around the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital). Or, it may develop later in life. There are many types of brain aneurysms. The most common type is called a berry aneurysm. This type can vary in size from a few millimeters (mm) to over a centimeter (cm). Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 cm or 1 inch (in). These are more common in adults. Berry aneurysms, especially when there is more than one, are sometimes passed down through families. Watch this video about: Cerebral aneurysm Other types of cerebral aneurysms involve widening of an entire blood vessel (fusiform aneurysms). Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Hardening of arteries ( atherosclerosis ), trauma, and infection can all injure the blood vessel wall and cause cerebral aneurysms. Brain aneurysms are relatively common. One in 50 people has a brain aneurysm, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture. Risk factors include: Family history of cerebral aneurysms Medical problems such as polycystic kidney disease , coarctation of the aorta , and endocarditis High blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamine drug use","A person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason. A brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe headache that a person may describe as ""the worst headache of my life."" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started. Symptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain. Symptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on. Symptoms may include: Double vision Loss of vision Headaches Eye pain Neck pain Stiff neck Ringing in the ears A sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured. Other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture may include: Confusion, no energy , sleepiness , or stupor Eyelid drooping Headaches with nausea or vomiting Muscle weakness or difficulty moving any part of the body Numbness or decreased sensation in any part of the body Problems speaking Seizures Stiff neck (occasionally) Vision changes (double vision, loss of vision) Loss of consciousness ( coma ) NOTE: A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency.

Angelman syndrome,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic condition that causes problems with the way a child's body and brain develop. The syndrome is present from birth (congenital). However, it often isn't diagnosed until about 6 to 12 months of age. This is when development problems are first noticed in most cases.","This condition involves the gene UBE3A . Most genes come in pairs. Children receive one from each parent. In most cases, both genes are active. This means information from both genes is used by the cells. With the UBE3A gene, both parents pass it on, but only the gene passed on from the mother is active. Angelman syndrome most often occurs because the UBE3A gene passed on from the mother doesn't work the way it should. In some cases, AS is caused when two copies of the UBE3A gene come from the father, and none come from the mother. This means neither gene is active, because they both come from the father.","In newborns and infants: Loss of muscle tone (floppiness) Trouble feeding Heartburn (acid reflux) Trembling arm and leg movements In toddlers and older children: Unstable or jerky walking Little or no speech Happy, excitable personality Laughing and smiling often Light hair, skin, and eye color compared to rest of family Small head size compared to body, flattened back of head Severe intellectual disability Seizures Excessive movement of the hands and limbs Sleep problems Tongue thrusting, drooling Unusual chewing and mouthing movements Crossed eyes Walking with arms uplifted and hands waving Most children with this disorder don't show symptoms until about 6 to 12 months. This is when parents may notice a delay in their child's development, such as not crawling or starting to talk. Children between 2 and 5 years of age start to show symptoms such as jerky walking, happy personality, laughing often, no speech, and intellectual problems.",,

Angiodysplasia of the colon,"Angiodysplasia of the colon (large intestine) is swollen, fragile blood vessels in the colon. These can result in bleeding and blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Angiodysplasia can also occur in the small intestine with similar causes and symptoms.","Angiodysplasia of the colon is mostly related to the aging and breakdown of the blood vessels. It is more common in older adults. It is almost always seen on the right side of the colon. Most likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions. Rarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults.",The symptoms vary. Older people may have symptoms such as: Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath due to anemia They may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon. Other people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum. There is no pain associated with angiodysplasia.,,Vascular ectasia of the colon; Colonic arteriovenous malformation; Hemorrhage - angiodysplasia; Bleed - angiodysplasia; Gastrointestinal bleeding - angiodysplasia; G.I. bleed - angiodysplasia; AVM
Angioedema,"Angioedema is swelling that is similar to hives, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface.","Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction . Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an allergen . However, in most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found. The following may cause angioedema: Allergies due to animal dander ( scales of shed skin), foods, insect bites or pollen Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat Medicines ( drug allergy ) such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors) Autoimmune diseases such as lupus Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections. Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including autoimmune disorders such as lupus, leukemia , and lymphoma). A rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called hereditary angioedema .","The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop. The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out. The welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.

Anisocoria,Anisocoria is unequal pupil size. The pupil is the black part in the center of the eye. It gets larger in dim light and smaller in bright light.,"The use of eye drops is a common cause of a harmless change in pupil size. Other medicines that get in the eyes, including medicine from asthma inhalers, can change pupil size. Other causes of unequal pupil sizes may include: Aneurysm in the brain Bleeding inside the skull caused by head injury Brain tumor or abscess (such as pontine lesions) Excess pressure in one eye caused by glaucoma Increased intracranial pressure, because of brain swelling, intracranial hemorrhage, acute stroke, or intracranial tumor Infection of membranes around the brain ( meningitis or encephalitis ) Migraine headache Seizure (pupil size difference may remain long after seizure is over) Tumor, mass, or lymph node in the upper chest or lymph node causing pressure on a nerve may cause decreased sweating , a small pupil, or drooping eyelid all on the affected side (Horner syndrome) Stroke Injury to the carotid or vertebral artery Diabetic oculomotor nerve palsy Prior eye trauma, including surgery for cataracts",,Treatment depends on the cause of the unequal pupil size.

This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.,,,,Ankle surgery; Arthroscopy - ankle; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopy; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopic
Ankle pain,Ankle pain involves any discomfort in one or both ankles.,"Ankle pain is often due to an ankle sprain. An ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments, which connect bones to one another. In most cases, the ankle is twisted inward, causing small tears in the ligaments. The tearing leads to swelling and bruising, making it difficult to bear weight on the joint. The ligament injuries are more common on the outside of your ankle but the inside ligaments can tear also. In addition to ankle sprains, ankle pain can be caused by: Damage or swelling of tendons (which join muscles to bone) or cartilage (which cushions joints) Infection in the ankle joint Osteoarthritis , gout , rheumatoid arthritis , Reiter syndrome , and other types of arthritis Problems in areas near the ankle that can cause you to feel pain in the ankle include: Blockage of blood vessels in the leg Heel pain or injuries Tendinitis around the ankle joint Nerve injuries (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or sciatica )",,"Home care for ankle pain depends on the cause and what other treatment or surgery has taken place. You may be asked to: Rest your ankle for several days. Try to NOT put much weight on your ankle. Put on an ACE bandage. You also can buy a brace that supports your ankle. Use crutches or a cane to help take the weight off a sore or unsteady ankle. Keep your foot raised above the level of your heart. When you are sitting or sleeping, place two pillows under your ankle. Ice the area right away. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day. Then, apply ice every 3 to 4 hours for 2 more days. Try acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other pain relievers made by the store. You may need a brace to support the ankle or a boot to rest your ankle. As the swelling and pain improve, you may still need to keep extra weight and stress off your ankle for a period of time. The injury may take a few weeks to many months to fully heal. Once the pain and swelling are mostly gone, the injured ankle will still be a little weaker and less stable than the uninjured ankle. You will need to start exercises to strengthen your ankle and avoid injury in the future. DO NOT begin these exercises until a health care professional tells you it is safe to start. You will also need to work on your balance and agility to avoid another injury or sprain. Other advice your health care provider may give you include: Avoid putting on extra weight since this could increase strain on your ankles. Warm up before exercising. Stretch the muscles and tendons that support the ankle. Avoid sports and activities for which you are not properly conditioned. Make sure that shoes fit you properly. Avoid high-heeled shoes. If you are prone to ankle pain or twisting your ankle during certain activities, use ankle support braces. These include air casts, ACE bandages, or lace-up ankle supports. Work on your balance and do agility exercises.",Pain - ankle
Ankle replacement,Ankle replacement is surgery to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. There are different types of ankle replacement surgeries.,,,,Ankle arthroplasty - total; Total ankle arthroplasty; Endoprosthetic ankle replacement; Ankle surgery
Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic form of arthritis. It mostly affects the bones and joints at the base of the spine where it connects with the pelvis. These joints can become swollen and inflamed. Over time, the affected spinal bones may join together.","AS is the main member of a family of similar forms of arthritis called spondyloarthritis. Other members include psoriatic arthritis, arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease and reactive arthritis. This family of arthritis affects up to 1 in 100 people. The cause of AS is unknown, however genes seem to play a role. The majority of people with AS are positive for the HLA-B27 gene, but not everyone who has this gene has AS. The disease often begins between ages 20 and 40, but it may begin before age 10. It affects more males than females.","AS starts with lower back pain that comes and goes but usually becomes present most of the time as the condition progresses. Pain and stiffness are worse at night, in the morning, or when you are less active. The discomfort may wake you from sleep. The pain often gets better with activity or exercise. Back pain may begin in the joint between the pelvis and spine (sacroiliac joints). Over time, it may involve all or part of the spine. Your lower spine may become less flexible. Over time, you may stand in a hunched forward position. Other parts of your body that may be affected include: The joints of the shoulders, knees and ankles, which may be swollen and painful The joints between your ribs and breastbone, so that you cannot expand your chest fully The eye, which may have swelling and redness called uveitis Fatigue is also a common symptom.

Annular pancreas,"An annular pancreas is a ring of pancreatic tissue that encircles the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The normal position of the pancreas is next to, but not surrounding the duodenum.","Annular pancreas is problem present at birth (congenital defect). Symptoms occur when the ring of pancreas squeezes and narrows the small intestine so that food cannot pass easily or at all. Newborns may have symptoms of complete blockage of the intestine. However, up to one half of people with this condition do not have symptoms until adulthood. There are also cases that are not detected because the symptoms are mild. Conditions that may be associated with annular pancreas include: Down syndrome Excess amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios) Other congenital gastrointestinal problems Pancreatitis","Newborns may not feed well. They may spit up more than normal, not drink enough breast milk or formula, and cry. Adult symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Fullness after eating Nausea or vomiting",,
Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery,"Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a heart defect. The left coronary artery (LCA), which carries blood to the heart muscle, begins from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta.","ALCAPA is a problem that occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy. The developing blood vessel does not attach correctly to the heart muscle. In the normal heart, the LCA originates from the aorta. It supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart as well as the mitral valve (the heart valve between the upper and lower chambers of the heart on the left side). The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In children with ALCAPA, the LCA originates from the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen. When ALCAPA occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. The tissue begins to die due to lack of oxygen. This can cause a heart attack in a baby. A condition known as coronary steal further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA. The low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormally connected LCA to flow back toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart muscle. This results in less blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. This problem can also lead to a heart attack in a baby. Coronary steal develops over time in babies with ALCAPA if the condition is not treated early.",Symptoms of ALCAPA in an infant include: Crying or sweating during feeding Irritability Pale skin Poor feeding Rapid breathing Symptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic) Symptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life.,,Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery; ALCAPA; ALCAPA syndrome; Bland-White-Garland syndrome; Congenital heart defect - ALCAPA; Birth defect - ALCAPA
Anorchia,Anorchia is the absence of both testes at birth.,"An embryo develops early sex organs in the first several weeks of pregnancy. In some cases, early testes do not develop in males before 8 weeks into the pregnancy. These babies will be born with female sex organs. In some cases, the testes disappear between 8 and 10 weeks. These babies will be born with ambiguous genitalia . This means the child will have parts of both male and female sex organs. In some cases, the testes may disappear between 12 and 14 weeks. These babies will have a normal penis and scrotum. However, they will not have any testes. This is known as congenital anorchia. It is also called the ""vanishing testes syndrome."" The cause is unknown. Genetic factors may be involved in some cases. This condition should not be confused with bilateral undescended testes , in which the testes are located in the abdomen or groin rather than the scrotum.",Symptoms may include: Normal outside genitals before puberty Failure to start puberty at the correct time,,Vanishing testes - anorchia; Empty scrotum - anorchia; Scrotum - empty (anorchia)

As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of the patella glides over the bones that make up the knee. Strong tendons help attach the kneecap to the bones and muscles that surround the knee. These tendons are called: The patellar tendon (where the kneecap attaches to the shin bone) The quadriceps tendon (where the thigh muscles attach to the top of the kneecap) Anterior knee pain may occur when the kneecap does not move properly and rubs against the lower part of the thigh bone. This may occur because: The kneecap is in an abnormal position (also called poor alignment of the patellofemoral joint). There is tightness or weakness of the muscles on the front and back of your thigh. You are doing too much activity that places extra stress on the kneecap (such as running, jumping or twisting, skiing, or playing soccer). Your muscles are not balanced and your core muscles maybe weaker. The groove in the thighbone where the kneecap normally rests is too shallow. You have flat feet. Your lower leg alignment is abnormal. Your core stability is weak and causes knee malalignment. Excess body weight or over activity increases the stress on your kneecap. Anterior knee pain is more common in: People who are overweight People who have had a dislocation, fracture, or other injury to the kneecap Runners, jumpers, skiers, bicyclists, and soccer players who exercise often Teenagers and healthy young adults, more often girls Other possible causes of anterior knee pain include: Arthritis Pinching of the inner lining of the knee during movement (called synovial impingement or plica syndrome)","Anterior knee pain is a dull, aching pain that is most often felt in one or more location: Behind the kneecap (patella) Below the kneecap On the sides of the kneecap One common symptom is a grating or grinding feeling when the knee is flexed (when the ankle is brought closer to the back of the thigh). Symptoms may be more noticeable with: Deep knee bends Going down stairs Running downhill Standing up from a squatting position or after sitting for a while",,Patellofemoral syndrome; Chondromalacia patella; Runner's knee; Patellar tendinitis; Jumper's knee

Anthrax,"Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs.","Anthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats. Humans who come into contact with infected animals can get sick with anthrax as well. There are three main routes of anthrax infection: skin (cutaneous), lung (inhalation), and mouth (gastrointestinal). Cutaneous anthrax occurs when anthrax spores enter the body through a cut or scrape on the skin. It is the most common type of anthrax infection. The main risk is contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, or with infected animals. People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, tanners, and wool workers. Inhalation anthrax develops when anthrax spores enter the lungs through the airways. It is most commonly contracted when workers breathe in airborne anthrax spores during processes such as tanning hides and processing wool. Breathing in spores means a person has been exposed to anthrax. But it does not mean the person will have symptoms. The bacterial spores must germinate or sprout (the same way a seed sprouts before a plant grows) before the actual disease occurs. This process usually takes 1 to 6 days. Once the spores germinate, they release several toxic substances. These substances cause internal bleeding, swelling, and tissue death. Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when someone eats anthrax-tainted meat. Injection anthrax can occur in someone who self-injects drugs (heroin). Anthrax may be used as a biological weapon or for bioterrorism.","Symptoms of anthrax differ, depending on the type of anthrax. Symptoms of cutaneous anthrax start 1 to 7 days after exposure: An itchy sore develops that is similar to an insect bite. This sore may blister and form a black ulcer (sore or eschar). The sore is usually painless, but it is often surrounded by swelling. A scab often forms, and then dries and falls off within 2 weeks. Complete healing can take longer. Symptoms of inhalation anthrax: Begins with fever, malaise , headache, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain Fever and shock may occur later Symptoms of gastrointestinal anthrax usually occur within 1 week and may include: Abdominal pain Bloody diarrhea Diarrhea Fever Mouth sores Nausea and vomiting (the vomit may contain blood) Symptoms of injection anthrax are similar to those of cutaneous anthrax.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease,Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease) is a rare disorder that can involve quickly worsening kidney failure and lung disease.,"Anti-GBM disease is an autoimmune disorder . It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. People with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys. These substances are called antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are antibodies against this membrane. They can damage the basement membrane, which can lead to kidney damage. Sometimes, this disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals. The immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs of the lungs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units.","Symptoms may occur very slowly over months or even years, but they often develop very quickly over days to weeks. Loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness are common early symptoms. Lung symptoms may include: Coughing up blood Dry cough Shortness of breath Kidney and other symptoms include: Bloody urine Burning sensation when urinating Nausea and vomiting Pale skin Swelling (edema) in any area of the body, especially in the legs",,Goodpasture syndrome; Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with pulmonary hemorrhage; Pulmonary renal syndrome; Glomerulonephritis - pulmonary hemorrhage

Antiphospholipid syndrome - APS,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses). When you have this condition, your body's immune system makes abnormal proteins that attack the blood cells and lining of the blood vessels. The presence of these antibodies can cause problems with blood flow and lead to dangerous clots in blood vessels throughout the body.","The exact cause of APS is not known. Both certain gene changes and other factors (such as an infection) may cause the problem to develop. It is often found in people with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The condition is more common in women than in men. It is often found in women who have a history of repeated miscarriages. Some people carry the antibodies mentioned above, but do not have APS. Certain triggers may cause these people to have a blood clot, including: Smoking Prolonged bed rest Pregnancy Hormone therapy or birth control pills Cancer Kidney disease","You may not have any symptoms, even though you have the antibodies. Symptoms that may occur include: Blood clots in the legs , arms or the lungs . The clots can be in either the veins or in the arteries. Recurrent miscarriages or still birth. Rash, in some people. In rare cases, clots suddenly develop in many arteries over a period of days. This is called catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS).

Aortic arch syndrome,The aortic arch is the top part of the main artery carrying blood away from the heart. Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch.,"Aortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms. In children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including: Congenital absence of a branch of the aorta Isolation of the subclavian arteries Vascular rings An inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent.","Symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include: Blood pressure changes Breathing problems Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes Numbness of an arm Reduced pulse Swallowing problems Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)",,Subclavian artery occlusive syndrome; Carotid artery occlusion syndrome; Subclavian steal syndrome; Vertebral-basilar artery occlusive syndrome; Takayasu disease; Pulseless disease
Aortic dissection,"Aortic dissection is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the major artery carrying blood out of the heart (aorta). As the tear extends along the wall of the aorta, blood can flow in between the layers of the blood vessel wall (dissection). This can lead to aortic rupture or decreased blood flow (ischemia) to organs.","When it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest towards the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta). Aortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta. When a tear occurs, it creates 2 channels: One in which blood continues to travel Another where blood stays still If the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta. This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them. An aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta ( aneurysm ). The exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include: Aging Atherosclerosis Blunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident High blood pressure Other risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include: Bicuspid aortic valve Coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta Connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders Heart surgery or procedures Pregnancy Swelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis Aortic dissection occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone, but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70.","In most cases, the symptoms begin suddenly, and include severe chest pain . The pain may feel like a heart attack. Pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping. It is felt below the breast bone, and then moves under the shoulder blades or to the back. Pain can move to the shoulder, neck, arm, jaw, abdomen, or hips. The pain changes position, often moving to the arms and legs as the aortic dissection gets worse. Symptoms are caused by a decrease of blood flowing to the rest of the body, and can include: Anxiety and a feeling of doom Fainting or dizziness Heavy sweating (clammy skin) Nausea and vomiting Pale skin ( pallor ) Rapid, weak pulse Shortness of breath and trouble breathing when lying flat ( orthopnea ) Other symptoms may include: Pain in the abdomen Stroke symptoms Swallowing difficulties from pressure on the esophagus",,Aortic aneurysm - dissecting; Chest pain - aortic dissection; Thoracic aortic aneurysm - dissection
Aortic regurgitation,Aortic regurgitation is a heart valve disease in which the aortic valve does not close tightly. This allows blood to flow from the aorta (the largest blood vessel) into the left ventricle (a chamber of the heart).,"Any condition that prevents the aortic valve from closing completely can cause this problem. When the valve does not close all the way, some blood comes back each time the heart beats. When a large amount of blood comes back, the heart must work harder to force out enough blood to meet the body's needs. The left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart widens (dilates) and the heart beats very strongly ( bounding pulse ). Over time, the heart becomes less able to supply enough blood to the body. In the past, rheumatic fever was the main cause of aortic regurgitation. The use of antibiotics to treat strep infections has made rheumatic fever less common. Therefore, aortic regurgitation is more commonly due to other causes. These include: Ankylosing spondylitis Aortic dissection Congenital (present at birth) valve problems, such as bicuspid valve Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) High blood pressure Marfan syndrome Reiter syndrome (also known as reactive arthritis) Syphilis Systemic lupus erythematosus Trauma to the chest Aortic insufficiency is most common in men between the ages of 30 and 60.","The condition often has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly. They may include: Bounding pulse Chest pain similar to angina (rare) Fainting Fatigue Palpitations (sensation of the heart beating) Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down Waking up short of breath after falling asleep Swelling of the feet, legs, or abdomen Uneven, rapid, racing, pounding, or fluttering pulse Weakness that is more likely to occur with activity",,Aortic valve prolapse; Aortic insufficiency; Heart valve - aortic regurgitation; Valvular disease - aortic regurgitation; AI - aortic insufficiency
Aortic stenosis,"The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In people with aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.","As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain. As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body. Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth. Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people. Calcium buildup of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcium buildup can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment). Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 to 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States. Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women.","Most people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests before any symptoms developed. Symptoms of aortic stenosis include: Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw. The chest may also feel tight or squeezed. Cough, possibly bloody . Breathing problems when exercising. Becoming easily tired. Feeling the heartbeat ( palpitations ). Fainting , weakness, or dizziness with activity. In infants and children, symptoms include: Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases) Failure to gain weight Poor feeding Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases) Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.",,Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis; Heart aortic stenosis; Valvular aortic stenosis; Congenital heart - aortic stenosis; Rheumatic fever - aortic stenosis

Aortopulmonary window,"Aortopulmonary window is a rare heart defect in which there is a hole connecting the major artery taking blood from the heart to the body (the aorta) and the one taking blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery). The condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth.","Normally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then the blood travels back to the heart and is pumped to the aorta and the rest of the body. Babies with an aortopulmonary window have a hole in between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Because of this hole, blood from the aorta flows into the pulmonary artery, and as a result too much blood flows to the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure. The bigger the defect, the more blood that is able to enter the pulmonary artery. The condition occurs when the aorta and pulmonary artery do not divide normally as the baby develops in the womb. Aortopulmonary window is very rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects. This condition can occur on its own or with other heart defects such as: Tetralogy of Fallot Pulmonary atresia Truncus arteriosus Atrial septal defect Patent ductus arteriosus Interrupted aortic arch Fifty percent of people usually have no other heart defects.","If the defect is small, it may not cause any symptoms. However, most defects are large.

Apert syndrome,Apert syndrome is a genetic disease in which the seams between the skull bones close earlier than normal. This affects the shape of the head and face. Children with Apert syndrome often have deformities of the hands and feet as well.,Apert syndrome can be passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to a child to have the condition. Most cases may occur without a known family history. Apert syndrome is caused by one of two changes to the FGFR2 gene. This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early. This condition is called craniosynostosis .,"Symptoms include: Early closure of sutures between bones of the skull, noted by ridging along sutures (craniosynostosis) Frequent ear infections Fusion or severe webbing of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers, often called ""mitten hands"" Hearing loss Large or late-closing soft spot on a baby's skull (fontanelle) Possible, slow intellectual development (varies from person to person) Prominent or bulging eyes Severe under-development of the midface Skeletal (limb) abnormalities Short height Webbing or fusion of the toes Several other syndromes can lead to a similar appearance of the face and head, but do not include the severe hand and foot features of Apert syndrome.

Aplastic,Aplastic is a medical term that means:,,,,
Aplastic anemia,"Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow does not make enough blood cells. Bone marrow is the soft, tissue in the center of bones that is responsible for producing blood cells and platelets.","Aplastic anemia results from damage to the blood stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Injury to the stem cells leads to a decrease in the number of these blood cell types. Aplastic anemia can be caused by: Use of certain medicines or exposure to toxic chemicals (such as chloramphenicol, benzene) Exposure to radiation or chemotherapy Autoimmune disorders Pregnancy Viruses Sometimes, the cause is unknown. In this case, the disorder is called idiopathic aplastic anemia.","Symptoms are due to the underproduction of red cells, white cells, and platelets. Symptoms may be severe from the start or gradually worsen over time as the disease progresses. Low red cell count (anemia) can cause: Fatigue Pallor (paleness) Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath with exercise Weakness Lightheadedness upon standing Low white cell count (leukopenia) causes an increased risk for infection. Low platelet count ( thrombocytopenia ) can result in bleeding. Symptoms include: Bleeding gums Easy bruising Nose bleeds Rash, small pinpoint red marks on the skin (petechiae) Frequent or severe infections (less common)",,Hypoplastic anemia; Bone marrow failure - aplastic anemia
Apnea of prematurity,"Apnea means ""without breath"" and refers to breathing that slows down or stops from any cause. Apnea of prematurity refers to breathing pauses in babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (premature birth).","There are several reasons why newborns, in particular those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including: The brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing. The muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life. Other stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including: Anemia Feeding problems Heart or lung problems Infection Low oxygen levels Temperature problems","The breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called ""periodic breathing."" This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early. It consists of episodes of either shallow breathing or short pauses in breathing lasting just a few seconds. These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing. This is generally considered a normal pattern and can be expected in less mature and even some full-term babies. However, the pattern of breathing, length of breathing pauses, and the age of the baby are both important when deciding if it needs to be further evaluated. Apnea episodes or ""events"" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a: Drop in heart rate.

Appendicitis,Appendicitis is a condition in which your appendix gets inflamed. The appendix is a small pouch attached to the end of the large intestine.,"Appendicitis is a very common reason for emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, a tumor or a parasite in rare cases.","The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to detect appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age. The first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney point . This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts. Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include: Chills and shaking Hard stools Diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting",,
Appetite - decreased,A decreased appetite is when your desire to eat is reduced. The medical term for a loss of appetite is anorexia.,"A decreased appetite is often seen in older adults.

The most common causes of acquired apraxia are: Brain tumor Condition that causes gradual worsening of the brain and nervous system (neurodegenerative illness) Dementia Stroke Traumatic brain injury Hydrocephalus Apraxia may also be seen at birth. Symptoms appear as the child grows and develops. The cause is unknown. Apraxia of speech is often present along with another speech disorder called aphasia . Depending on the cause of apraxia, a number of other brain or nervous system problems may be present.","A person with apraxia is unable to put together the correct order of muscle movements. At times, a completely different word or action is used or occurs than the one the person intended to speak or make. The person is often aware of the mistake. Symptoms of apraxia of speech include: Distorted, repeated, or left out speech sounds or words. The person has difficulty putting words together in the correct order. Struggling to pronounce the right word. More difficulty using longer words, either all the time, or sometimes. Ability to use short, everyday phrases or sayings (such as ""How are you?"") without a problem. Better writing ability than speaking ability.

Armpit lump,"An armpit lump is a swelling or bump under the arm. A lump in the armpit can have many causes. These include swollen lymph nodes, infections, or cysts.","Lumps in the armpit may have many causes. Lymph nodes act as filters that can catch germs or cancerous tumor cells. When they do, lymph nodes increase in size and are easily felt. Reasons lymph nodes in the armpit area may be enlarged are: Arm or breast infection Some body-wide infections, such as mono, AIDS, or herpes Cancers , such as lymphomas or breast cancer Cysts or abscesses under the skin may also produce large, painful lumps in the armpit. These may be caused by shaving or use of antiperspirants (not deodorants). This is most often seen in teens just beginning to shave.

Arrhythmias,"An arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart rate (pulse) or heart rhythm. The heart can beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly.","Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way. The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway. Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster. Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system. Abnormal extra signals may occur. Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed. Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart. Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are: Abnormal levels of potassium, magnesium, or other substances in the body Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart failure or an enlarged heart Overactive thyroid gland Watch this video about: Arrhythmias Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including: Alcohol or stimulant drugs Certain medicines Cigarette smoking (nicotine) Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are: Atrial fibrillation or flutter Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) Heart block or atrioventricular block Multifocal atrial tachycardia Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Sick sinus syndrome Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome","When you have an arrhythmia, your heartbeat may be: Too slow (bradycardia) Too quick (tachycardia) Irregular, uneven, possibly with extra or skipped beats An arrhythmia may be present all of the time or it may come and go. You may or may not feel symptoms when the arrhythmia is present. Or, you may only notice symptoms when you are more active. Symptoms can be very mild, or they may be severe or even life threatening. Common symptoms that may occur when the arrhythmia is present could include: Chest pain Fainting Lightheadedness , dizziness Paleness Palpitations (feeling your heart beat fast or irregularly) Shortness of breath Sweating",,Abnormal heart rhythms; Bradycardia; Tachycardia; Fibrillation
Arterial embolism,Arterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part.,"An ""embolus"" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot. The word ""emboli"" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism. An arterial embolism may be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death ( necrosis ). Arterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a stroke . Ones that occur in the heart cause a heart attack . Other sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes. Risk factors for arterial embolism include: Abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation Injury or damage to an artery wall Conditions that increase blood clotting Another condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is mitral stenosis . Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli. A common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the abdominal organs, legs and feet. Paradoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart. The clot can then move to an artery and block blood flow to the brain (stroke) or other organs. If a clot travels and lodges in the arteries supplying blood flow to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus .",You may not have any symptoms. Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow. Symptoms of an arterial embolism in the arms or legs may include: Cold arm or leg Decreased or no pulse in an arm or leg Lack of movement in the arm or leg Pain in the affected area Numbness and tingling in the arm or leg Pale color of the arm or leg (pallor) Weakness of an arm or leg Later symptoms: Blisters of the skin fed by the affected artery Shedding (sloughing) of skin Skin erosion ( ulcer ) Tissue death (necrosis; skin is dark and damaged) Symptoms of a clot in an organ vary with the organ involved but may include: Pain in the part of the body that is involved Temporarily decreased organ function,,
Arterial insufficiency,Arterial insufficiency is any condition that slows or stops the flow of blood through your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other places in your body.,"One of the most common causes of arterial insufficiency is atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries."" Fatty material (called plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to become narrow and stiff. As a result, it is hard for blood to flow through your arteries. Blood flow may be suddenly stopped due to a blood clot . Clots can form on the plaque or less often travel from another place such as the heart or other artery (also called embolus).","Symptoms depend on where your arteries become narrowed: If it affects your heart arteries, you may have chest pain (angina pectoris) or a heart attack . If it affects your brain arteries, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke . If it affects the arteries that bring blood to your legs, you may have frequent leg cramping when you walk called claudication. If it affects the arteries in your belly area, you may have pain after you eat called abdominal angina (due to mesenteric ischemia).",,

Arthritis,Arthritis is inflammation or degeneration of one or more joints. A joint is the area where 2 bones meet. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis.,"Arthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness. Other joint structures affected by arthritis include: The synovium The bone next to the joint Ligaments and tendons Sacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae) Joint inflammation and damage may result from: An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue) Broken bone General ""wear and tear"" on joints Infection, most often by bacteria or viruses Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate In most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis. Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex. Osteoarthritis , which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type. Other, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include: Ankylosing spondylitis Crystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in children) Bacterial infections Psoriatic arthritis Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (in adults) Scleroderma Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)","Arthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement. Symptoms can include: Joint pain Joint swelling Joint deformity Reduced ability to move the joint Redness and warmth of the skin around a joint Joint stiffness, especially in the morning",,Joint inflammation; Joint degeneration

Artificial urinary sphincter,"Sphincters in the urinary system are muscles that allow your body to hold in urine. An inflatable artificial (man-made) sphincter is a medical device. This device keeps urine from leaking. It is used when your urinary sphincter no longer works well. When you need to urinate, the cuff of the artificial sphincter can be relaxed. This allows urine to flow out.",,,,Artificial sphincter (AUS) - urinary; Inflatable artificial sphincter
Asbestosis,Asbestosis is a lung disease that occurs from breathing in asbestos fibers.,"Breathing in asbestos fibers can cause scar tissue (fibrosis) to form inside the lung. Scarred lung tissue does not expand and contract normally. How severe the disease is depends on: How long the person was exposed to asbestos The amount that was breathed in The type of fibers breathed in Often, the symptoms aren't noticed for 20 years or more after the asbestos exposure. Asbestos fibers were commonly used in construction before 1975. Asbestos exposure occurs in asbestos mining and milling, construction, fireproofing, and other industries. Household members of asbestos workers can also be exposed from asbestos particles brought home on the worker's clothing. Other asbestos-related diseases include: Pleural plaques Malignant mesothelioma (cancer of the pleura, the lining of the lung), which can develop 20 to 40 years after exposure Pleural effusion , which is a collection of fluid that develops around the lung a few years after asbestos exposure and is benign Lung cancer These conditions can coexist with asbestosis. Workers today are less likely to get asbestos-related diseases because of government regulations. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing asbestos-related diseases.",Symptoms may include any of the following: Chest pain Cough Shortness of breath with activity (slowly gets worse over time) Tightness in the chest Possible other symptoms include: Clubbing of fingers Nail abnormalities,,Pulmonary fibrosis - from asbestos exposure; Interstitial pneumonitis - from asbestos exposure
Ascariasis,Ascariasis is an infection with the parasitic roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides.,"People get ascariasis by consuming food or drink that is contaminated with roundworm eggs. Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease. Once consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine. As the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 to 24 months. An estimated 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults.","Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include: Bloody sputum (mucus coughed up by the lower airways) Cough, wheezing Low-grade fever Passing worms in stool Shortness of breath Skin rash Stomach pain Vomiting or coughing up worms Worms leaving the body through the nose or mouth",,Intestinal parasite - ascariasis; Roundworm - ascariasis
Ascites,Ascites is the build-up of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and abdominal organs.,"Ascites often results from high pressure in certain veins of the liver (portal hypertension) and low blood levels of a protein called albumin . Diseases that can cause severe liver damage can lead to ascites. These include: Chronic hepatitis C or B infection Alcohol overuse over many years Fatty liver disease (metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH) previously called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH) Cirrhosis caused by genetic diseases People with certain cancers in the abdomen may develop ascites. These include cancer of the appendix, colon, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bile ducts, and liver. Other conditions that can cause ascites include: Clots in certain veins of the liver (portal vein thrombosis) Congestive heart failure Pancreatitis Thickening and scarring of the sac-like covering of the heart (pericarditis) Kidney dialysis may also be linked to ascites.","Symptoms may develop slowly or suddenly depending on the cause of ascites. You may have no symptoms if there is only a small amount of fluid in the belly. As more fluid collects, you may have abdominal pain and bloating. Large amounts of fluid can cause shortness of breath. This happens because the fluid pushes up on the diaphragm, which in turn compresses the lower lungs. Many other symptoms of liver failure may also be present.",,Portal hypertension - ascites; Cirrhosis - ascites; Liver failure - ascites; Alcohol use - ascites; End-stage liver disease - ascites; ESLD - ascites; Pancreatitis ascites
Asherman syndrome,Asherman syndrome is the formation of scar tissue in the uterine cavity. The problem most often develops after uterine surgery.,"Asherman syndrome is a rare condition. In most cases, it occurs in women who have had several dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures. A severe pelvic infection unrelated to surgery may also lead to Asherman syndrome. Adhesions in the uterine cavity can also form after infection with tuberculosis or schistosomiasis. These infections are rare in the United States. Uterine complications related to these infections are even less common.","The adhesions may cause: Amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods) Repeated miscarriages Infertility However, such symptoms could be related to several conditions.

Aspergillosis,Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic response due to the aspergillus fungus.,"Aspergillosis is caused by a fungus called aspergillus. The fungus is often found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves. Although most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a healthy immune system. There are several forms of aspergillosis: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the fungus. This infection usually develops in people who already have lung problems such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Aspergilloma is a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring such as tuberculosis or lung abscess. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection with pneumonia. It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system. This can be from cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medicines that lower the number or function of white blood cells or weaken the immune system.","Symptoms depend on the type of infection. Symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include: Cough Coughing up blood or brownish mucus plugs Fever General ill feeling (malaise) Wheezing Weight loss Other symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include: Bone pain Chest pain Chills Decreased urine output Headaches Increased phlegm production, which may be bloody Shortness of breath Skin sores (lesions) Vision problems",,Aspergillus infection

Asthma,"Asthma is a chronic disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.","Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway. Asthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers, or by other causes. Common asthma triggers include: Animals (pet hair or dander) Dust mites Certain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air (pollution) or in food Physical activity Mold Pollen Respiratory infections, such as the common cold and many other viruses Strong emotions (stress) Tobacco or other inhalant that is smoked Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma . The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies , such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ) or eczema . Others have no history of allergies.","Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity. Most people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some people have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of increased shortness of breath. Wheezing or a cough may be the main symptom. Asthma attacks can last for minutes to days. An asthma attack may start suddenly or develop slowly over several hours or days. It may become dangerous if airflow is severely blocked. Symptoms of asthma include: Cough with or without sputum (phlegm) production Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing ( intercostal retractions ) Shortness of breath that gets worse with exercise or activity Whistling sound or wheezing as you breathe Pain or tightness in the chest Difficulty sleeping Abnormal breathing pattern (breathing out takes more than twice as long as breathing in) Emergency symptoms that need prompt medical help include: Bluish color to the lips and face (cyanosis) Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion, during an asthma attack Extreme difficulty breathing Rapid pulse Severe anxiety due to shortness of breath Sweating Difficulty speaking Breathing temporarily stops",,Bronchial asthma; Wheezing - asthma - adults

Asthma in children,"Asthma is a disease that causes the airways to swell and get narrow. It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.","Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. As a result, less air is able to pass through. Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together. In children who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens , or triggers . Common asthma triggers include: Animals (hair or dander) Dust, mold, and pollen Aspirin and other medicines Changes in weather (most often cold weather) Chemicals in the air or in food Tobacco smoke Exercise Strong emotions Viral infections, such as the common cold","Breathing problems are common.

Astigmatism,Astigmatism is a type of refractive error of the eye. Refractive errors cause blurred vision. They are the most common reason why a person goes to see an eye professional.,"People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye. If the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry. With astigmatism, the cornea is abnormally curved. This curve causes vision to be out of focus. The cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is most often present from birth. Astigmatism often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. If astigmatism gets worse, it may be a sign of keratoconus . Astigmatism is very common. It sometimes occurs after certain types of eye surgery, such as cataract surgery .","Astigmatism makes it hard to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.",,

Ataxia - telangiectasia,Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease. It affects the brain and other parts of the body.,"Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an autosomal recessive trait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder. The disease results from a variant in the ATM gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Boys and girls are equally affected.","Symptoms include: Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood that can include ataxic gait (cerebellar ataxia ), jerky gait, unsteadiness Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12 Delayed walking Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight Discoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots) Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee Enlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes Jerky or abnormal eye movements ( nystagmus ) late in the disease Premature graying of the hair Seizures Sensitivity to radiation, including x-rays Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring)",,Louis-Bar syndrome
Atelectasis,"Atelectasis is the collapse of part or, much less commonly, all of a lung.","Atelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis is not the same as another type of collapsed lung called pneumothorax , which occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. In atelectasis, there is usually fluid between the lung and the chest wall and the air sacs within the lung fill with fluid. Atelectasis is common after surgery or in people who are or were in the hospital. Risk factors for developing atelectasis include: Anesthesia Use of a breathing tube Foreign object in the airway (most common in children) Lung disease Mucus that plugs the airway Pressure on the lung caused by a buildup of fluid between the ribs and the lungs (called a pleural effusion ) Prolonged bed rest with few changes in position Shallow breathing (may be caused by painful breathing or muscle weakness) Tumors that block an airway",Symptoms may include any of the following: Breathing difficulty Chest pain Cough There are no symptoms if atelectasis is mild.,,Partial lung collapse
Atheroembolic renal disease,Atheroembolic renal disease (AERD) occurs when small particles made of hardened cholesterol and fat spread to the small blood vessels of the kidneys.,"AERD is linked to atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis is a common disorder of the arteries. It occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form a hard substance called plaque. In AERD, cholesterol crystals break off from the plaque lining the arteries. These crystals move into the bloodstream. Once in circulation, the crystals get stuck in tiny blood vessels called arterioles. There, they reduce blood flow to tissues and cause swelling (inflammation) and tissue damage that can harm the kidneys or other parts of the body. Acute arterial occlusion occurs when the large artery that supplies blood to the kidney suddenly becomes blocked. The kidneys are involved about half of the time that plaque fragments block blood flow to blood vessels. Other body parts that may be involved include the skin, eyes, muscles and bones, brain and nerves, and organs in the abdomen. Acute kidney failure is possible if the blockages of the kidney blood vessels are severe. Atherosclerosis of the aorta is the most common cause of AERD. The cholesterol crystals may also break off during aortic angiography , cardiac catheterization , or surgery of the aorta or other major arteries. In some cases, AERD may occur without a known cause. The risk factors for AERD are the same as risk factors for atherosclerosis, including age, male sex, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.",,,Renal disease - atheroembolic; Cholesterol embolization syndrome; Atheroemboli - renal; Atherosclerotic disease - renal
Atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis, sometimes called ""hardening of the arteries,"" occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. These deposits are called plaques. Over time, these plaques can narrow or completely block the arteries and cause problems throughout the body.","Watch this video about: Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them. Clots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them. These blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death. It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke. High blood cholesterol levels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age. For many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats. Other factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include: Diabetes Family history of hardening of the arteries High blood pressure Lack of exercise Being overweight or obese Smoking","Atherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked. If the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Narrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain.",,Hardening of the arteries; Arteriosclerosis; Plaque buildup - arteries; Hyperlipidemia - atherosclerosis; Cholesterol - atherosclerosis
Athlete's foot,Athlete's foot is an infection of the feet caused by fungus. The medical term is tinea pedis or ringworm of the foot.,"Athlete's foot occurs when a certain fungus grows on the skin of your feet. The same fungus may also grow on other parts of the body. However, the feet are most commonly affected, especially between the toes. Athlete's foot is the most common type of tinea infection. The fungus thrives in warm, moist areas. Your risk for getting athlete's foot increases if you: Wear closed shoes, especially if they are plastic-lined Keep your feet wet for long periods Sweat a lot Develop a minor skin or nail injury Athlete's foot is easily spread. It can be passed through direct contact or contact with items such as shoes, stockings, and shower or pool surfaces.","The most common symptom is cracked, flaking, peeling skin between the toes or on the side of the foot. Other symptoms can include: Red and itchy skin Burning or stinging pain Blisters that ooze or get crusty If the fungus spreads to your nails, they can become discolored, thick, and even crumble. Athlete's foot may occur at the same time as other fungal or yeast skin infections such as jock itch .",,Tinea pedis; Fungal infection - feet; Tinea of the foot; Infection - fungal - feet; Ringworm - foot
Atopic dermatitis,Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves scaly and itchy rashes. It is a type of eczema.,"Atopic dermatitis is due to a reaction in the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing itching, swelling and redness. People with atopic dermatitis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks specific proteins that maintain the skin's barrier to water. Atopic dermatitis is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood. People with atopic dermatitis often have asthma or seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive for allergy skin tests. However, atopic dermatitis is not caused by allergies. The following can make atopic dermatitis symptoms worse: Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites, or animals Cold and dry air in the winter Colds or the flu Contact with irritants and chemicals Contact with rough materials, such as wool Dry skin Emotional stress Drying out of the skin from taking frequent baths or showers and swimming very often Getting too hot or too cold, as well as sudden changes in temperature Perfumes or dyes added to skin lotions or soaps","Skin changes may include: Blisters with oozing and crusting Dry skin all over the body, or areas of bumpy skin on the back of the arms and front of the thighs Ear discharge or bleeding Raw areas of the skin from scratching Skin color changes, such as more or less color than the normal skin tone Skin redness or inflammation around the blisters Thickened or leather-like areas, which can occur after long-term irritation and scratching The type and location of the rash can depend on the age of the person: In children younger than age 2, the rash may begin on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. The rash is often itchy and forms blisters that ooze and crust over. In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet. In adults, the rash may be limited to the hands, eyelids, or genitals. Rashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak. Intense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the ""itch that rashes"" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.",,Infantile eczema; Dermatitis - atopic; Eczema
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter,Atrial fibrillation (Afib) and atrial flutter are common types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which affect the upper chambers (atria) of the heart.,"When working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way. Electrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). In people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the sequence of heart muscle contractions (rhythm) in the upper chambers of the heart (atria). In AFib: The atria do not contract in an organized pattern. The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In people with atrial flutter, the atria beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern. These problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age. Common causes of AFib include: Alcohol use (especially binge drinking) Coronary artery disease Heart attack or heart bypass surgery Heart failure or an enlarged heart Heart valve disease (most often the mitral valve) Hypertension Medicines Overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) Pericarditis Sick sinus syndrome","You may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern. When symptoms are present, they may include one or more of the following: Pulse that feels rapid, racing, pounding or thumping, fluttering, irregular, or too slow. Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ). Confusion . Dizziness , lightheadedness. Fainting . Fatigue . Weakness. Loss of ability to exercise. Shortness of breath and anxiety. Sweating. Chest pain or pressure , which may be a sign of a heart attack. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure.",,Auricular fibrillation; AFib; A-fib; Afib; Supraventricular arrhythmia; AF; AFL
Atrial myxoma,An atrial myxoma is a noncancerous tumor in the upper left or right side of the heart. It most often grows on the wall that separates the two sides of the heart. This wall is called the atrial septum.,"A myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor. This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else. Primary cardiac tumors such as myxomas are rare. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart. They most often begin in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. They can occur in other intra-cardiac sites as well. Atrial myxomas are sometimes linked with valve obstruction stenosis and atrial fibrillation . Myxomas are more common in women. About 1 in 10 myxomas are passed down through families (inherited). These tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age.","Many myxomas will not cause symptoms. These are often discovered when an imaging study (echocardiogram, MRI, CT) is done for another reason. Symptoms may occur at any time, but often they go along with a change in body position. Symptoms of a myxoma may include: Breathing difficulty when lying flat or on one side or the other Breathing difficulty when asleep Chest pain or tightness Dizziness Fainting Sensation of feeling your heart beat ( palpitations ) Shortness of breath with activity Symptoms due to embolism of tumor material The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic mitral stenosis (narrowing of the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle). Right atrial myxomas rarely produce symptoms until they have grown to be quite large (5 inches wide, or 13 cm). Other symptoms may include: Bluish skin , especially on the fingers (Raynaud phenomenon) Cough Curvature of nails accompanied by soft tissue swelling ( clubbing ) of the fingers Fever Fingers that change color upon pressure or with cold or stress General discomfort ( malaise ) Joint pain Swelling in any part of the body Weight loss without trying",,Cardiac tumor - myxoma; Heart tumor - myxoma
Atrial septal defect (ASD),Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart defect that is present at birth (congenital).,"Normally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen. When blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left. If this occurs, there will be less oxygen in the blood that goes to the body. Atrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum. The primum defects are linked to other heart defects of the ventricular septum and mitral valve . Secundum defects can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers. Very small defects (less than 5 millimeters or ¼ inch) are less likely to cause problems. Smaller defects are often discovered much later in life than larger ones. Along with the size of the ASD, where the defect is located plays a role that affects blood flow and oxygen levels. The presence of other heart defects is also important. ASD is not very common.","A person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later. Symptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood. They can include: Difficulty breathing ( dyspnea ) Frequent respiratory infections in children Feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) in adults Shortness of breath with activity",,Congenital heart defect - ASD; Birth defect heart - ASD; Primum ASD; Secundum ASD
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem caused by the presence of one or more of these findings:,ADHD often begins in childhood. But it may continue into the adult years. ADHD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls. It is not clear what causes ADHD. It may be linked to genes and home or social factors. Experts have found that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of children without ADHD. Brain chemicals are also different.,"ADHD symptoms fall into three groups: Not being able to focus (inattentiveness) Being extremely active ( hyperactivity ) Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity) Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors. INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork Has problems focusing during tasks or play Doesn't listen when spoken to directly Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores Has problems organizing tasks and activities Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork) Often loses things, such as homework or toys Is easily distracted Is often forgetful Has trouble concentrating HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS Fidgets or squirms in seat Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so Has problems playing or working quietly Is often on the go, acts as if ""driven by a motor"" Talks all the time IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS Blurts out answers before questions have been completed Has problems awaiting their turn Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games) Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.",,ADD; ADHD; Childhood hyperkinesis
Atypical pneumonia,Pneumonia is inflamed or swollen lung tissue due to infection with a germ.,"Bacteria that cause atypical pneumonia include: Pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae often affects people younger than age 40. Pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae bacteria occurs year round. Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila bacteria is seen more often in middle-aged and older adults, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses or a weak immune system. It can be more severe. This type of pneumonia is also called Legionnaire disease .","Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. Pneumonia due to legionella gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days. The most common symptoms of pneumonia are: Chills Cough (with legionella pneumonia, you may cough up bloody mucus) Fever, which may be mild or high Shortness of breath (may only occur when you exert yourself) Other symptoms include: Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough Confusion, most often in older people or those with legionella pneumonia Headache Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Muscle aches and joint stiffness Sweating and clammy skin Less common symptoms include: Diarrhea (often with legionella pneumonia) Ear pain (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Eye pain or soreness (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Neck lump (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Rash (with mycoplasma pneumonia) Sore throat (with mycoplasma pneumonia)",,Walking pneumonia; Community-acquired pneumonia - atypical

Autism spectrum disorder,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder. It often appears in the first 2 to 3 years of life. ASD affects the brain's ability to develop normal social and communication skills.,"The exact cause of ASD isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child. Other causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms. Some parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD. The increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD. Autism spectrum disorder now includes syndromes that used to be regarded as separate disorders: Autistic disorder Asperger syndrome Childhood disintegrative disorder Pervasive developmental disorder","Most parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old. Children with ASD often have problems with: Pretend play Social interactions Verbal and nonverbal communication Some children seem normal before age 1 or 2. They then suddenly lose language or social skills they already had. Symptoms can vary from moderate to severe. A person with ASD may: Be very sensitive to sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste (for example, they refuse to wear ""itchy"" clothes and get upset if they're forced to wear the clothes) Be very upset when routines are changed Repeat body movements over and over Be unusually attached to things Communication problems may include: Can't start or maintain a conversation Uses gestures instead of words Develops language slowly or not at all Doesn't adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at Doesn't refer to self the right way (for example, says ""you want water"" when the child means ""I want water"") Doesn't point to show other people objects (normally occurs in the first 14 months of life) Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials Social interaction problems may include: Doesn't make friends Doesn't play interactive games Is withdrawn May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact May treat others as objects Prefers to be alone rather than with others Isn't able to show empathy Response to sensory information problems may include: Doesn't startle at loud noises Has very high or very low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste May find normal noises painful and hold their hands over their ears May withdraw from physical contact because it's too stimulating or overwhelming Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects May have a very high or very low response to pain Problems with play may include: Doesn't imitate the actions of others Prefers solitary or ritualistic play Shows little pretend or imaginative play Behaviors may include: Acts out with intense tantrums Gets stuck on a single topic or task Has a short attention span Has very narrow interests Is overactive or very passive Is aggressive toward others or self Shows a strong need for things being the same Repeats body movements",,Autism; Autistic disorder; Asperger syndrome; Childhood disintegrative disorder; Pervasive developmental disorder

Autoerythrocyte sensitivity,Autoerythrocyte sensitivity means your body is sensitive to its own red blood cells (erythrocytes). This generally results in the destruction of red blood cells. The destructive process is called hemolysis.,,,,
Autoimmune disorders,An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders.,"The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins , cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues. The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: The destruction of body tissue Abnormal growth of an organ Changes in organ function An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: Blood vessels Connective tissues Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas Joints Muscles Red blood cells Skin A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: Addison disease Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) Dermatomyositis Graves disease Hashimoto thyroiditis Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) Multiple sclerosis Myasthenia gravis Pernicious anemia Reactive arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Sjögren syndrome Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) Type I diabetes","Symptoms will vary, based on the type and location of the faulty immune response.

Autoimmune hepatitis,Autoimmune hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver. It occurs when immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them.,"This form of hepatitis is an autoimmune disease . The body's immune system cannot tell the difference between healthy body tissue and harmful, outside substances. The result is an immune response that destroys normal body tissues. Liver inflammation, or hepatitis, may occur along with other autoimmune diseases. These include: Graves disease Inflammatory bowel disease Rheumatoid arthritis Scleroderma Sjögren syndrome Systemic lupus erythematosus Thyroiditis Type 1 diabetes Ulcerative colitis Autoimmune hepatitis may occur in family members of people with autoimmune diseases.

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease,"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of inherited conditions that affect the tubules of the kidneys, causing the kidneys to gradually lose their ability to work.","ADTKD is caused by mutations in certain genes. These gene problems are passed down through families (inherited) in an autosomal dominant pattern . This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Often, many family members have the disease. With all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged. These are the structures in the kidneys that allow most fluid in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood. The abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are: UMOD gene -- causes ADTKD- UMOD , or uromodulin kidney disease MUC1 gene -- causes ADTKD- MUC1 , or mucin-1 kidney disease REN gene -- causes ADTKD- REN , or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2) HNF1B gene -- causes ADTKD- HNF1B , or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5) When the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS.","Early in the disease, depending on the form of ADTKD, symptoms may include: Excessive urination (polyuria) Gout Salt cravings Urination at night (nocturia) Weakness As the disease worsens, symptoms of kidney failure may develop, which include: Easy bruising or bleeding Fatigue , weakness Frequent hiccups Headache Increased skin color (skin may appear yellow or brown) Itching Malaise (general ill feeling) Muscle twitching or cramps Nausea Pale skin Reduced sensation in the hands, feet, or other areas Vomiting blood or blood in the stool Weight loss Seizures Confusion, decreased alertness, coma",,ADTKD; Medullary cystic kidney disease; Renin associated kidney disease; Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy; Uromodulin associated kidney disease

Avian influenza,Avian influenza A viruses cause the influenza (flu) infection in birds. These viruses occur in wild birds and can infect domestic poultry. The viruses that cause the disease in birds can change their genes (mutate) so they can spread to other animals and humans.,"The first avian influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997. It was called avian influenza (H5N1). The outbreak was linked to chickens. Since then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East. The virus has caused illness and even death in humans. While rare, avian influenza has also spread to humans in the United States. The latest outbreak in the United States started in 2022 and has affected over 1,100 flocks of birds in 48 states. In March 2024, the virus was detected for the first time in dairy cows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports at least 16 states where H5N1 bird flu has infected dairy cows. Since April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported cases of H5N1 in humans in the United States. Symptoms have included a cough, runny nose, sore throat, chills, fever, and conjunctivitis (eye infection). In December 2024, one person was hospitalized with a severe case of H5N1 after exposure to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. Currently, the risk for infection in people is low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to monitor the situation. Your risk of getting the bird flu virus is higher if: You work with poultry or cattle (such as farmers or farm workers). You have exposure to backyard bird flocks and wild birds (such as through hunting). You travel to countries where the virus is present. You are exposed to sick or dead animals infected with the virus. You are exposed to animal feces, litter, or other material contaminated by animals infected with H5N1. You eat raw or undercooked poultry meat, eggs, or unpasteurized (raw) milk or cheese from animals infected with H5N1. No one has gotten avian flu virus from eating properly cooked animals or animal products. Health care workers and people who live in the same house as people with bird flu may also be at higher risk for infection. Avian flu viruses can live in the environment for long periods of time. Infection may be spread just by touching surfaces that have the virus on them. Birds who were infected with the avian flu can shed the virus in their feces and saliva for as long as 10 days.","Symptoms of avian flu infection in humans depend on the strain of virus. The avian influenza virus in humans causes typical flu-like symptoms, such as: Cough Diarrhea Trouble breathing Fever greater than 100.4°F (38°C) Headache General ill feeling (malaise) Muscle aches Runny nose Sore throat",,Bird flu; H5N1; H5N2; H5N8; H7N9; Avian influenza A (HPAI) H5

Bartter syndrome,Bartter syndrome is a group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys.,"There are five gene defects known to be associated with Bartter syndrome. The condition is present at birth (congenital). The condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. People affected by Bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting. The condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.",This disease usually occurs in childhood. Symptoms include: Constipation Less weight gain than other children of similar age and sex ( growth failure ) Frequent urination ( urinary frequency ) Low blood pressure Kidney stones Muscle cramping and weakness,,Potassium wasting; Salt-wasting nephropathy
Basal cell skin cancer,Basal cell cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Most skin cancers are basal cell cancer.,"The top layer of the skin is called the epidermis. The bottom layer of the epidermis is the basal cell layer. With basal cancer, cells in this layer are the ones that become cancerous. Most basal cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation. This type of skin cancer is most common in people over age 50. But it can also occur in younger people who have had extensive sun exposure. Basal cell cancer is almost always slow-growing. It rarely spreads to other parts of the body.

Call poison control or a hospital emergency room if the person who is stung has an allergy to the insect or was stung inside the mouth or throat. People with severe reactions may need to go to the hospital. To treat the sting: Try to remove the stinger from the skin (if it is still present). To do this, carefully scrape the back of a knife or other thin, blunt, straight-edged object (like a credit card) across the stinger if the person can keep still and it is safe to do so. If you are pulling the stinger out, it is important to not pinch the venom sac at the end of the stinger. If this sac is squeezed or broken, more venom will be released. Clean the area thoroughly with soap and water. Place ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has problems with blood circulation, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage. Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.

It may occur when you move your head in a certain position.,"Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear. The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance. BPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) break free and float inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position. BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk of developing BPPV may increase if you have: Family members with BPPV Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head) Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis","BPPV symptoms include any of the following: Feeling like you are spinning or moving Feeling like the world is spinning around you Loss of balance Nausea and vomiting Hearing loss Vision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving The spinning sensation: Is usually triggered by moving your head Often starts suddenly Lasts a few seconds to minutes Certain positions can trigger the spinning feeling: Rolling over in bed Tilting your head up to look at something",,Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV; Dizziness - positional

Beriberi,Beriberi is a disease in which the body does not have enough thiamine (vitamin B1).,"There are two major types of beriberi: Wet beriberi: Affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome : Affects the nervous system. Beriberi is rare in the United States. This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1. In rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics. Beriberi can occur in infants when they are: Breastfed and the mother's body is lacking in thiamine Fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine Some medical treatments that can raise your risk of beriberi are: Getting dialysis Taking high doses of diuretics (water pills)",Symptoms of dry beriberi include: Difficulty walking Loss of feeling (sensation) in hands and feet Loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs Mental confusion Pain Speech difficulties Strange eye movements (nystagmus) Tingling Vomiting Symptoms of wet beriberi include: Awakening at night short of breath Increased heart rate Shortness of breath with activity Swelling of the lower legs,,Thiamine deficiency; Vitamin B1 deficiency

It collects in the stomach and fails to pass through the intestines.,"Chewing on or eating hair or fuzzy materials (or indigestible materials such as plastic bags) can lead to the formation of a bezoar. The rate is very low. The risk is greater among people with intellectual disability or emotionally disturbed children. Generally, bezoars are mostly seen in females aged 10 to 19 years.",Symptoms may include: Indigestion Stomach upset or distress Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Pain Gastric ulcers,,Trichobezoar; Hairball
Bicuspid aortic valve,"A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is an aortic valve that only has two leaflets, instead of three.","The aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the aorta. It prevents the blood from flowing back from the aorta into the heart when the pumping chamber relaxes. BAV is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart is developing. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common congenital heart defect . BAV often runs in families. A BAV may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This leakage is called aortic regurgitation . The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up. This is called aortic stenosis , which causes the heart to pump harder than usual to get blood through the valve. The aorta may become enlarged with this condition. BAV is more common among males than females. A BAV often exists in babies with coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta). BAV is also seen in diseases in which there is a blockage to blood flow on the left side of the heart.","Most of the time, BAV is not diagnosed in infants or children because it causes no symptoms. However, the abnormal valve can leak or become narrow over time. Symptoms of such complications may include: Baby or child tires easily Chest pain Difficulty breathing Rapid and irregular heartbeat ( palpitations ) Loss of consciousness ( fainting ) Pale skin ( pallor ) If a baby has other congenital heart problems, they may cause symptoms that will lead to the discovery of a BAV.",,Bicommissural aortic valve; Valvular disease - bicuspid aortic valve; BAV
Bilateral hydronephrosis,Bilateral hydronephrosis is the enlargement of the parts of the kidney that collect urine. Bilateral means both sides.,"Bilateral hydronephrosis occurs when urine is unable to drain from the kidney into the bladder. Hydronephrosis is not itself a disease. It occurs as a result of a problem that prevents urine from draining out of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Disorders linked with bilateral hydronephrosis include: Acute bilateral obstructive uropathy -- sudden blockage of the kidneys Bladder outlet obstruction -- blockage of the bladder, which does not allow drainage Chronic bilateral obstructive uropathy -- a gradual blockage of both kidneys is most often from a common singular obstruction Neurogenic bladder -- poorly functional bladder Posterior urethral valves -- flaps on the urethra that causes poor emptying of the bladder (in boys) Prune belly syndrome -- poorly emptying bladder that causes distention of the belly Retroperitoneal fibrosis -- abnormal scar tissue that blocks the ureters Ureteropelvic junction obstruction -- blockage of the kidney at the point where the ureter enters the kidney Vesicoureteric reflux -- backup of the urine from the bladder up to the ureter or kidney Uterine prolapse -- when the bladder drops down and presses into the vaginal area. This causes a kink in the urethra, which prevents the urine from emptying out of the bladder.","In a baby, signs of a problem are often found before birth during a pregnancy ultrasound. A urinary tract infection in a newborn baby can signal a blockage in the kidney. An older child who gets repeat urinary tract infections should also be checked for blockage. A higher than normal number of urinary tract infections is often the only symptom of the problem. Common symptoms in adults may include: Back pain Nausea, vomiting Fever Need to urinate often Decreased urine output Blood in the urine Urinary incontinence",,Hydronephrosis - bilateral
Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure,"Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure is a type of seizure that involves the entire body. It is also called grand mal seizure. The terms generalized seizure, convulsion, or epilepsy are most often associated with bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.","Seizures result from electrical overactivity in the brain. Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures may occur in people of any age. They can occur once (single episode). Or, they can occur as part of a repeated, chronic illness (epilepsy). Some seizures are due to psychological problems (psychogenic or non-epileptic).","Many people with generalized bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have an aura with one or more symptoms before the seizure such as: Vision, taste, smell, or sensory changes. Seeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there ( hallucinations ). Dizziness or other symptoms. Some people have a focal onset seizure (only affecting one part of the body) that becomes a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. The seizures often result in rigid muscles (tonic phase). This is followed by violent muscle contractions (clonic phase). Other symptoms that occur during the seizure may include: Biting the cheek or tongue Clenched teeth or jaw Loss of urine or stool control (incontinence) Stopped breathing or difficulty breathing Blue skin color (cyanosis) After the seizure, the person may have: Confusion Drowsiness or sleepiness that lasts for 1 hour or longer (called the post-ictal state) Loss of memory (amnesia) about the seizure episode Headache Weakness of one side of the body for a few minutes to a few hours following seizure (called Todd paralysis)",,Seizure - tonic-clonic; Seizure - grand mal; Grand mal seizure; Seizure - generalized; Epilepsy - generalized seizure

Bile duct obstruction,Bile duct obstruction is a blockage in the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine.,"Bile is a liquid released by the liver. It contains cholesterol, bile salts, and waste products such as bilirubin . Bile salts help your body break down (digest) fats. Bile passes out of the liver through the bile ducts and is stored in the gallbladder. After a meal, it is released into the small intestine. When the bile ducts become blocked, bile builds up in the liver, and jaundice (yellow color of the skin) develops due to the increasing level of bilirubin in the blood. The possible causes of a blocked bile duct include: Cysts of the common bile duct Enlarged lymph nodes in the porta hepatis (an area on the underside of the liver through which the bile duct passes) Gallstones Inflammation of the bile ducts Narrowing of the bile ducts from scarring Injury of a bile duct from gallbladder surgery Tumors of the bile ducts or pancreas Tumors that have spread to the biliary system Liver and bile duct worms (flukes) The risk factors for a blocked bile duct include: A history of gallstones, chronic pancreatitis , or pancreatic cancer Injury to the abdominal area Recent biliary surgery Recent biliary cancer (such as bile duct cancer ) The blockage can also be caused by infections. This is more common in people with weakened immune systems.",Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain in the upper right side Dark urine Fever Itching Jaundice (yellow skin color) Nausea and vomiting Clay-colored or pale stools,,Biliary obstruction
Bile duct stricture,"A bile duct stricture is an abnormal narrowing, most often of the common bile duct. This is a tube that moves bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion.","A bile duct stricture is often caused by injury to the bile ducts during surgery. For example, it may occur after surgery to remove the gallbladder. Other causes of this condition include: Cancer of the bile duct, liver or pancreas Damage and scarring due to a gallstone in the bile duct Damage or scarring after gallbladder removal Pancreatitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis",Symptoms include: Abdominal pain on the upper right side of belly Chills Fever Itching General feeling of discomfort Loss of appetite Jaundice Nausea and vomiting Pale or clay-colored stools,,Bile duct stricture; Biliary stricture
Bili lights,Bili lights are a type of light therapy (phototherapy) that is used to treat newborn jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow coloring of the skin and eyes.

Biliary atresia,Biliary atresia is a blockage in the tubes (ducts) that carry a liquid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder.,"Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. The bile ducts carry a digestive fluid from liver to small bowel to break down fats and filter out waste from the body. The cause of the disease is not clear. It may be due to: Viral infection after birth Exposure to toxic substances Multiple genetic factors Perinatal injury Some medicines such as carbamazepine It more commonly affects people of East Asian and African-American descent. The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat. In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.","Symptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks. Jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucus membranes) develops slowly 2 to 3 weeks after birth. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month. After that point, the baby will lose weight and become irritable, and will have worsening jaundice.

Bilirubin encephalopathy,Bilirubin encephalopathy is a rare neurological condition that occurs in some newborns with severe jaundice.,"Bilirubin encephalopathy (BE) is caused by very high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created as the body gets rid of old red blood cells. High levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow (jaundice). If the level of bilirubin is very high or a baby is very ill, the substance will move out of the blood and collect in the brain tissue if it is not bound to albumin (protein) in the blood. This can lead to problems such as brain damage and hearing loss. The term ""kernicterus"" refers to the yellow staining caused by bilirubin. This is seen in parts of the brain on autopsy. This condition most often develops in the first week of life, but may be seen up until the third week. Some newborns with Rh hemolytic disease are at high risk for severe jaundice that can lead to this condition. Rarely, BE can develop in seemingly healthy babies.","The symptoms depend on the stage of BE. Not all babies with kernicterus on autopsy have had definite symptoms. Early stage: Extreme jaundice Absent startle reflex Poor feeding or sucking Extreme sleepiness (lethargy) and low muscle tone (hypotonia) Middle stage: High-pitched cry Irritability May have arched back with neck hyperextended backwards, high muscle tone (hypertonia) Poor feeding Late stage: Stupor or coma No feeding Shrill cry Muscle rigidity, markedly arched back with neck hyperextended backwards Seizures",,Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND); Kernicterus

It is in the center of the lower abdomen.,"Bladder cancer often starts from the cells lining the bladder. These cells are called transitional cells. These tumors are classified by the way they grow: Papillary tumors look like warts and are attached to a stalk. Carcinoma in situ tumors are flat. They are much less common. But they are more invasive and have a worse outcome. The exact cause of bladder cancer is not known. But several things that may make you more likely to develop it include: Cigarette smoking -- Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers may be caused by cigarette smoke. Personal or family history of bladder cancer -- Having someone in the family with bladder cancer increases your risk of developing it. Chemical exposure -- Bladder cancer can be caused by coming into contact with cancer-causing chemicals (often at work). These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk. Chemotherapy -- The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk for bladder cancer. Radiation treatment -- Radiation therapy to the pelvis region for treatment of cancers of the prostate, testes, cervix, or uterus increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Bladder infection -- A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer. Research has not shown clear evidence that using artificial sweeteners leads to bladder cancer in humans.",Symptoms of bladder cancer can include: Abdominal pain Blood in the urine Bone pain or tenderness if the cancer spreads to the bone Fatigue Painful urination Urinary frequency and urgency Urine leakage (incontinence) Weight loss Other diseases and conditions can cause similar symptoms.

Bleeding disorders,Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions in which there is a problem with the body's blood clotting process. These disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Bleeding can also begin on its own and may be difficult to stop.,"Watch this video about: Blood clotting Normal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding. Problems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe. Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from: Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease Treatments, such as the use of drugs to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain drugs often lead to the acquired forms.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Bleeding into joints or muscles Bruising easily Heavy bleeding Heavy menstrual bleeding Nosebleeds that do not stop easily Excessive bleeding with surgical procedures Umbilical cord bleeding after birth The problems that occur depend on the specific bleeding disorder, and how severe it is.",,Coagulopathy
Bleeding esophageal varices,The esophagus (food pipe) is the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Varices are enlarged veins that may be found in the esophagus in people with cirrhosis of the liver. These veins may rupture and bleed.,"Scarring ( cirrhosis ) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus. The extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward forming esophageal varices. Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear. Any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease can cause esophageal varices. Varices can also occur in the upper part of the stomach. These are called gastric varices.","People with chronic liver disease and esophageal varices may have no symptoms. If there is only a small amount of bleeding, the only symptom may be dark or black streaks in the stools. If larger amounts of bleeding occur, symptoms may include: Black, tarry stools Bloody stools Lightheadedness Paleness Symptoms of chronic liver disease Vomiting blood",,Liver cirrhosis - varices; Cryptogenic chronic liver disease - varices; End-stage liver disease - varices; Alcoholic liver disease - varices; NASH varices; Alcoholic hepatitis - varices; Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) varices
Bleeding gums,Bleeding gums can be a sign that you have or may develop gum disease. Ongoing gum bleeding may be due to plaque buildup on the teeth. It can also be a sign of a serious medical condition.,"The main cause of bleeding gums is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This may lead to a condition called gingivitis , or inflamed gums. Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. This may lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jaw bone disease known as periodontitis . Other causes of bleeding gums include: Any bleeding disorders Brushing too hard Hormonal changes during pregnancy Ill-fitting dentures or other dental appliances Improper flossing Infection, which can be either in a tooth or the gum Leukemia , a type of blood cancer Scurvy , a vitamin C deficiency Use of blood thinners Vitamin K deficiency",,"Visit the dentist at least once every 6 months for plaque removal. Follow your dentist's home care instructions. Brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristle toothbrush at least twice a day. It is best if you can brush after every meal. Also, flossing teeth twice a day can prevent plaque from building up and turning into tartar. Your dentist may tell you to rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide and water, or a mouth rise designed to treat gum inflammation. Some rinses contain alcohol, so consult with your dentist prior to using one of these types. It can help to follow a balanced, healthy diet. Try to avoid snacking between meals and cut down on the carbohydrates you eat. Other tips to help with bleeding gums: Have a periodontal exam. Do not use tobacco, since it makes bleeding gums worse. Tobacco use can also mask other problems that cause bleeding of the gums. Control gum bleeding by applying pressure directly on the gums with a gauze pad soaked in ice water. If you have been diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, take vitamin supplements. Avoid aspirin unless your health care provider has recommended that you take it. If side effects of a medicine are causing the bleeding gums, ask your provider to prescribe a different medicine. Never change your medicines without first talking to your provider. Use an oral irrigation device on the low setting to massage your gums. See your dentist if your dentures or other dental appliances do not fit well or are causing sore spots on your gums.

Blocked tear duct,A blocked tear duct is a partial or complete blockage in the pathway that carries tears from the surface of the eye into the nose.,"Tears are constantly being made to help protect the surface of your eye. They drain into a very small opening (punctum) in the corner of your eye, near your nose. This opening is the entrance to the nasolacrimal duct. If this duct is blocked, the tears will build up and overflow onto the cheek. This occurs even when you are not crying. In children, the duct may not be completely developed at birth. It may be closed or covered by a thin film, which causes a partial blockage. In adults, the duct can be damaged by an infection, injury, or a tumor.","The main symptom is increased tearing (epiphora), which causes tears to overflow onto the face or cheek. In babies, this tearing becomes noticeable during the first 2 to 3 weeks after birth. Sometimes, the tears may appear to be thicker. The tears may dry and become crusty. If there is pus in the eyes or the eyelids get stuck together, your baby may have an eye infection called conjunctivitis .",,Dacryostenosis; Blocked nasolacrimal duct; Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO)

Botulism,Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The bacteria may enter the body through wounds or by eating improperly canned or preserved food.,"Clostridium botulinum are found in soil and untreated water throughout the world. The bacteria produce protective spores to help them survive. In certain conditions, such as improperly preserved or canned food, these spores can grow and produce a toxin. When eaten, even tiny amounts of this toxin can lead to severe poisoning. Foods that can be contaminated include: Home-canned vegetables Cured pork and ham Smoked or raw fish Honey or corn syrup Baked potatoes cooked in foil Carrot juice Chopped garlic in oil Infant botulism occurs when a baby eats Clostridium botulinum spores and the bacteria grow in the baby's intestines. The most common cause of infant botulism is eating honey or corn syrup or using pacifiers that have been coated with honey. Clostridium botulinum can be found normally in the stool of some infants. Infants develop botulism when the bacteria grow in their gut. Botulism may also occur if the bacteria enter open wounds and produce toxins there. About 110 cases of botulism are reported in the United States each year. Most of the cases are in infants.","Symptoms often appear 8 to 36 hours after you eat food contaminated with the toxin. There is no fever with this infection. In adults, symptoms may include: Abdominal cramps Breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory failure Difficulty swallowing and speaking Double vision Nausea Vomiting Weakness with paralysis (equal on both sides of the body) Symptoms in infants may include: Constipation Drooling Poor feeding and weak sucking Respiratory distress Weak cry Weakness, loss of muscle tone",,Infant botulism
Bowel incontinence,"Bowel incontinence is the loss of bowel control, causing you to unexpectedly pass stool. This can range from sometimes leaking a small amount of stool and passing gas, to not being able to control bowel movements.","Reasons people have bowel incontinence include: Ongoing (chronic) constipation. This causes the anal muscles and intestines to stretch and weaken, leading to diarrhea and stool leakage. Fecal impaction . It is most often caused by chronic constipation. This leads to a lump of stool that partly blocks the large intestine. Long-term laxative use. Colectomy or bowel surgery. Not sensing that it's time to have a bowel movement. Emotional problems. Gynecological, prostate, or rectal surgery. Injury to the anal muscles due to childbirth (in women). Nerve or muscle damage (from injury, tumor, or radiation). Severe diarrhea that causes leakage. Severe hemorrhoids or rectal prolapse. Stress of being in an unfamiliar environment.",,"Often, simple changes may help reduce bowel incontinence. Your provider may suggest one or more of these treatments. Diet -- Track the foods you eat to see if any types of foods cause problems. Foods that may lead to incontinence in some people include: Alcohol Caffeine Dairy products (in people who are unable to digest lactose , a sugar found in most dairy products) Fatty, fried, or greasy foods Spicy foods Cured or smoked meats Sweeteners such as fructose, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol Fiber -- Adding bulk to your diet may thicken loose stool. To increase fiber : Eat more whole grains. Aim for 30 grams of fiber a day. Read food labels to see how much fiber is in breads, cereals, and other foods. Use products such as Metamucil that have a type of fiber called psyllium, which adds bulk to stools. Bowel retraining and pelvic floor exercises -- These methods can help you control your anal sphincter muscle when you have a bowel movement. Your provider can show you exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and anal muscles. Bowel retraining involves trying to have a bowel movement at certain times of the day. Some people can't tell when it's time to have a bowel movement. Sometimes they can't move well enough to safely get to the toilet on their own. These people need special care. They may become used to not getting to the toilet when it's time to have a bowel movement. To prevent this problem, help them get to the toilet after meals and when they feel the urge. Also, make sure the bathroom is safe and comfortable. Using special pads or undergarments can help an incontinent person feel safe when they leave home. You can find these products in pharmacies and in many other stores. SURGERY If treatment does not work, surgery may help correct the problem. There are several types of procedures. The choice of surgery is based on the cause of the incontinence and the person's general health. Anal sphincter repair -- This surgery may help people whose anal muscle ring (sphincter) isn't working well due to injury or aging. The anal muscles are reattached to tighten the sphincter and help the anus close more completely. Gracilis muscle transplant -- In people who have lost nerve function in the anal sphincter, gracilis muscle transplants may help. The gracilis muscle is taken from the inner thigh. It is put around the sphincter to help tighten the sphincter muscle. Artificial bowel sphincter -- The artificial sphincter consists of 3 parts: a cuff that fits around the anus, a pressure-regulating balloon, and a pump that inflates the cuff. During surgery, the artificial sphincter is placed around the anal sphincter. The cuff stays inflated to maintain continence. You have a bowel movement by deflating the cuff. The cuff will automatically re-inflate in 10 minutes. Sacral nerve stimulator -- A device can be put inside the body to stimulate the nerves that maintain continence. Fecal diversion -- Sometimes, this procedure is performed in people who are not helped by other therapies. The large intestine is attached to an opening in the abdominal wall called a colostomy. Stool passes through this opening to a special bag. You will need to use a colostomy bag to collect stool most of the time. Injection treatment -- This procedure injects a thick gel (Solesta) into the anal sphincter to bulk it up. If treatment does not get rid of bowel incontinence, you can use special fecal collection devices to contain the stool and protect your skin from breakdown. These devices have a drainable pouch attached to an adhesive wafer. The wafer has a hole cut through the center, which fits over the opening to the anus.",Uncontrollable passage of feces; Loss of bowel control; Fecal incontinence; Incontinence - bowel

Bowlegs,Bowlegs is a condition in which the knees stay wide apart when a person stands with the feet and ankles together. It is considered normal in children under 18 months.,"Infants are born bowlegged because of their folded position in the mother's womb. Bowed legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk and the legs begin to bear weight (about 12 to 18 months old). By around age 3, the child can most often stand with the ankles apart and the knees just touching. If the bowed legs are still present, the child is called bowlegged.

The type depends on the amount of arm paralysis: Brachial plexus palsy most often affects only the upper arm. It is also called Duchenne-Erb or Erb-Duchenne paralysis. Klumpke paralysis affects the lower arm and hand. This is less common. The following factors increase the risk of NBPP: Breech delivery Maternal obesity Larger-than-average newborn (such as an infant of a diabetic mother ) Difficulty delivering the baby's shoulder after the head has already come out (called shoulder dystocia) NBPP is less common than in the past. Cesarean delivery is used more often when there are concerns about a difficult delivery. Although a C-section reduces the risk of injury, it does not prevent it. A C-section also carries other risks. NBPP may be confused with a condition called pseudoparalysis . This is seen when the infant has a fracture of the clavicle (collarbone) and is not moving the arm because of pain, but there is no nerve damage.",Symptoms can be seen right away or soon after birth. They may include: No movement in the newborn's upper or lower arm or hand Absent Moro reflex on the affected side Arm extended (straight) at elbow and held against body Decreased grip on the affected side (depending on the site of injury),,Klumpke paralysis; Erb-Duchenne paralysis; Erb's palsy; Brachial palsy; Brachial plexopathy; Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; Birth-related brachial plexus palsy; Neonatal brachial plexus palsy; NBPP
Brain abscess,"A brain abscess is a collection of pus, immune cells, and other material in the brain, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.","Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess. The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause. The following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess: A weakened immune system (such as in people with HIV/AIDS ) Chronic disease, such as cancer Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy ) Congenital heart disease","Symptoms may develop slowly, over a period of several weeks, or they may develop suddenly. They may include: Changes in mental status , such as confusion, slow response or thinking, unable to focus, or sleepiness Decreased ability to feel touch or pain (sensation) Fever and chills Headache, seizures , or stiff neck Language problems Loss of muscle function, typically on one side Vision changes Vomiting Weakness in a limb (such as an arm or leg)",,Abscess - brain; Cerebral abscess; CNS abscess

Brain herniation,Brain herniation is the shifting of the brain tissue from one space in the skull to another through various folds and openings.,"Brain herniation occurs when something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues. This is most often the result of brain swelling or bleeding from a head injury, stroke , or brain tumor. Brain herniation can be a side effect of tumors in the brain, including: Metastatic brain tumor Primary brain tumor Herniation of the brain can also be caused by other factors that lead to increased pressure inside the skull, including: Collection of pus and other material in the brain, usually from a bacterial or fungal infection ( abscess ) Bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage) Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling ( hydrocephalus ) Strokes that cause brain swelling Swelling after radiation therapy Defect in brain structure, such as a condition called Arnold-Chiari malformation Swelling due to loss of oxygen ( hypoxia ) to the brain Brain herniation can occur: From side to side or down, under, or across rigid membrane like the tentorium or falx Through a natural bony opening at the base of the skull called the foramen magnum Through openings created during brain surgery","Signs and symptoms of increased pressure inside the skull (that may lead to brain herniation) may include: High blood pressure Irregular or slow pulse Severe headache Weakness Cardiac arrest (no pulse) Loss of consciousness, coma Loss of all brainstem reflexes (blinking, gagging, and pupils reacting to light) Respiratory arrest (no breathing) Wide (dilated) pupils and no movement in one or both eyes",,Herniation syndrome; Transtentorial herniation; Uncal herniation; Subfalcine herniation; Tonsillar herniation; Herniation - brain

Brain tumor - children,A brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that grow in the brain.,"The cause of primary brain tumors is often unknown. Some primary brain tumors are related to other syndromes or can run in a family. They can be: Not cancerous (benign) Invasive (spread to nearby areas) Cancerous (malignant) Brain tumors are classified based on: The exact site of the tumor The type of tissue involved Whether it is cancerous Brain tumors can directly kill brain cells. They can also damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull. Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare. COMMON TUMOR TYPES Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They most often develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children. Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10. Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign or malignant. Therapy to control the tumor is based on the location and type of ependymoma. Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop in children is about age 6.","Symptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly. Headaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include: Headaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours Headaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position Headaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion Sometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include: Changes in personality and behavior Unable to concentrate Increased sleep Memory loss Problems with reasoning Other possible symptoms are: Seizures Unexplained frequent vomiting Gradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg Hearing loss with or without dizziness Speech difficulty Unexpected vision problem (if it occurs with a headache), including vision loss (peripheral vision) in one or both eyes, or double vision Problems with balance Weakness or numbness",,Glioblastoma multiforme - children; Ependymoma - children; Glioma - children; Astrocytoma - children; Medulloblastoma - children; Neuroglioma - children; Oligodendroglioma - children; Meningioma - children; Cancer - brain tumor (children)
Brain tumor - primary - adults,A primary brain tumor is a group (mass) of abnormal cells that start in the brain.,"Primary brain tumors include any tumor that starts in the brain. Primary brain tumors can start from brain cells, the membranes around the brain (meninges), nerves, or glands. Tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also damage cells by producing inflammation, placing pressure on other parts of the brain, and increasing pressure within the skull . The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. There are many risk factors that could play a role: Radiation therapy used to treat brain cancers increases the risk of brain tumors up to 20 or 30 years later. Some inherited conditions increase the risk of brain tumors, including neurofibromatosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome. Lymphomas that begin in the brain in people with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV) are sometimes linked to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus. These have not proven to be risk factors: Exposure to radiation at work, or to power lines, cell phones, cordless phones, or wireless devices Head injuries Smoking Hormone therapy SPECIFIC TUMOR TYPES Brain tumors are classified depending on: Location of the tumor Type of tissue involved Whether they are noncancerous ( benign ) or cancerous ( malignant ) Other factors Sometimes, tumors that start out less aggressive can change their biologic behavior and become more aggressive. Tumors can occur at any age, but many types are most common in a certain age group. In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are the most common. Gliomas come from glial cells around the nerve cells of the brain such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. Gliomas are divided into three types: Astrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (can be noncancerous), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas. Oligodendroglial tumors. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors. These are called mixed gliomas. Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor. Meningiomas and schwannomas are two other types of brain tumors. These tumors: Occur most often between ages 40 and 70. Are usually noncancerous, but can still cause serious complications and death from their size or location. Some are cancerous and aggressive. Other primary brain tumors in adults are rare. These include: Ependymomas Craniopharyngiomas Pituitary tumors Primary ( central nervous system - CNS ) lymphoma Pineal gland tumors Primary germ cell tumors of the brain","Some tumors do not cause symptoms until they are very large. Other tumors have symptoms that develop slowly. Symptoms depend on the tumor's size, location, how far it has spread, and whether there is brain swelling. The most common symptoms are: Changes in the person's mental function Headaches Seizures (especially in older adults) Weakness in one part of the body Headaches caused by brain tumors may: Be worse when the person wakes up in the morning, and clear up in a few hours Occur during sleep Occur with vomiting, confusion, double vision, weakness, or numbness Get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position Other symptoms can include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma) Changes in hearing, taste, or smell Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, different temperatures, or other stimuli Confusion or memory loss Difficulty swallowing Difficulty writing or reading Dizziness or abnormal sensation of movement (vertigo) Eye problems such as eyelid drooping, pupils of different sizes, uncontrollable eye movement, vision difficulties (including decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision) Hand tremor Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, clumsiness, trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually on just one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, behavior, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking Other symptoms that may occur with a pituitary tumor: Abnormal nipple discharge Absent menstruation (periods) Breast development in men Enlarged hands, feet Excessive body hair Facial changes Low blood pressure Obesity Sensitivity to heat or cold",,Glioblastoma multiforme - adults; Ependymoma - adults; Glioma - adults; Astrocytoma - adults; Medulloblastoma - adults; Neuroglioma - adults; Oligodendroglioma - adults; Lymphoma - adults; Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) - adults; Meningioma - adults; Cancer - brain tumor (adults)
Branchial cleft cyst,"A branchial cleft cyst is a birth defect. It is caused when fluid fills a space, or sinus, left in the neck when a baby develops in the womb. After the baby is born, it appears as a lump in the neck or just below the jawbone.","Branchial cleft cysts form during development of the embryo . They occur when tissues in the neck area (branchial cleft) fail to develop normally. The birth defect may appear as open spaces called cleft sinuses, which may develop on one or both sides of the neck. A branchial cleft cyst may form due to fluid in a sinus. The cyst or sinus can become infected.","The cysts are most often seen in children. In some cases, they are not seen until adulthood.

Breast cancer,Breast cancer is cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast. There are two main types of breast cancer:,"Breast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer: Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as family history, you cannot control. The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history. Understanding your risk factors can help you take steps to lower your risk. Some women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents. Genes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers. A screening tool with questions about your and your family's medical history can help your health care provider determine whether you are at risk for carrying these genes. If you may be at high risk due to a known variant gene such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, a blood test can show if you carry the genes. Certain other genes may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer. Breast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not increase the risk for breast cancer. There is also no evidence of a direct link between breast cancer and pesticides.","Early breast cancer often does not cause symptoms. This is why regular breast cancer screening is important, so cancers that don't have symptoms may be found earlier. As the cancer grows, symptoms may include: Breast lump or lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt. Change in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange. Fluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus. In men, breast cancer symptoms include breast lump, breast pain, and breast tenderness.

Breast enlargement in males,"When abnormal breast tissue develops in males, it is called gynecomastia. It is important to find out if the excess growth is breast tissue and not excess fat tissue (lipomastia).","Normal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men. There are other causes as well. HORMONE CHANGES Breast enlargement is usually caused by an imbalance of estrogen (female hormone) and testosterone (male hormone). Males have both types of hormones in their body. Changes in the levels of these hormones, or in how the body uses or responds to these hormones, can cause enlarged breasts in males. In newborns, breast growth is caused by being exposed to estrogen from the mother. About one half of boy babies are born with enlarged breasts, called breast buds. They usually go away in 2 to 6 months, but can last longer. In preteens and teens, breast growth is caused by normal hormone changes that occur during puberty. More than one half of boys develop some breast enlargement during puberty. Breast growth often goes away in about 6 months to 2 years. In men, hormone changes due to aging can cause breast growth. This may occur more often in overweight or obese men and in men age 50 and older. HEALTH CONDITIONS Certain health problems can cause breast growth in adult men, including: Chronic liver disease Kidney failure and dialysis Low testosterone level Obesity (also the most common cause of breast growth due to fat) Rare causes include: Genetic defects Overactive thyroid or underactive thyroid Tumors (including benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called prolactinoma) MEDICINES AND MEDICAL TREATMENT Some medicines and treatments that can cause breast growth in men include: Cancer chemotherapy Hormone treatment for prostate cancer, such as flutamide (Proscar), or for enlarged prostate, such as finasteride (Propecia) or bicalutamide Radiation treatment of the testicles HIV/AIDS medicines Corticosteroids and anabolic steroids Estrogen (including those in soy products) Heartburn and ulcer medicines, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or proton pump inhibitors Anti-anxiety medicines, such as diazepam (Valium) Heart medicines, such as spironolactone (Aldactone), digoxin (Lanoxin), amiodarone, and calcium channel blockers Antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral) Antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil) Herbals such as lavender, tea tree oil, and dong quai Opioids DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE Using certain substances can cause breast enlargement: Alcohol Amphetamines Heroin Marijuana Methadone Gynecomastia has also been linked to exposure to endocrine disrupters. These are common chemicals often found in plastics. Men who have enlarged breasts may have an increased risk for breast cancer . Breast cancer in men is rare. Signs that may suggest breast cancer include: One-sided breast growth Firm or hard breast lump that feels like it is attached to the tissue Skin sore over the breast Bloody discharge from the nipple",,"For swollen breasts that are tender, applying cold compresses may help.

Other tips include: Stop taking all recreational drugs, such as marijuana Stop taking all nutritional supplements or any medicines you are taking for bodybuilding",Gynecomastia; Breast enlargement in a male
Breast infection,A breast infection is an infection in the tissue of the breast.,"Breast infections are usually caused by common bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus ) found on normal skin. The bacteria enter through a break or crack in the skin, usually on the nipple. The infection takes place in the fatty tissue of the breast and causes swelling . This swelling pushes on the milk ducts. The result is pain and lumps in the infected breast. Breast infections usually occur in women who are breastfeeding. Breast infections inflammation that are not related to breastfeeding might be due to a rare form of breast cancer .","Symptoms of a breast infection may include: Breast enlargement or fullness on one side only Breast lump Breast pain Fever and flu-like symptoms, including nausea and vomiting Itching Nipple discharge (may contain pus) Swelling , tenderness, and warmth in breast tissue Skin redness, most often in wedge shape Tender or enlarged lymph nodes in armpit on the same side",,Mastitis; Infection - breast tissue; Breast abscess - post partum mastitis; Breastfeeding - mastitis

Breast lump,"A breast lump is swelling, growth, or mass in the breast.","Lumps in a woman are most often either fibroadenomas or cysts, or just normal variations in breast tissue known as fibrocystic changes. Fibrocystic changes are painful, lumpy breasts. This is a benign condition that does not increase your risk for breast cancer. Symptoms are most often worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts. Fibroadenomas are noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery. They move easily inside the breast tissue and are usually not tender. They occur most often during the reproductive years. These lumps do not have cancer or become cancerous except in rare cases. A health care provider may sometimes suspect a lump is a fibroadenoma based on an exam. Also, an ultrasound and a mammogram can often provide information to determine if a lump looks like a fibroadenoma. The only way to be sure, however, is to have a needle biopsy or remove the whole lump. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, often just before your menstrual period. Ultrasound can determine if a lump is a cyst. It can also reveal whether it is a simple, complicated, or complex cyst. Simple cysts are just sacs filled with fluid. They do not need to be removed and may go away on their own. If a simple cyst is growing or causing pain, it can be aspirated. A complicated cyst has a little bit of debris in the fluid and can either be watched with ultrasound or the fluid can be drained. A complex cyst looks more worrisome on ultrasound. Your provider may recommend either a follow up ultrasound or a needle biopsy. Depending on the results, the cyst may be monitored with ultrasound exams or removed surgically. Other causes of breast lumps include: Breast cancer. Injury. Blood may collect and feel like a lump called a hematoma if your breast gets badly bruised. These lumps tend to get better on their own in a few days or weeks. If they do not improve, your provider may have to drain the blood. Lipoma. This is a collection of fatty tissue. Milk cysts (sacs filled with milk). These cysts can occur with breastfeeding. Breast abscess .

This can be very painful. If you also have an area of redness, call your health care provider, as this may be a sign of an infection or other more serious breast problem. Breastfeeding itself may also cause breast pain. Fibrocystic breast changes are a common cause of breast pain. Fibrocystic breast tissue contains lumps or cysts that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period. Certain medicines may also cause breast pain, including: Oxymetholone Chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medicines Water pills (diuretics) Digitalis preparations Methyldopa Spironolactone Oral contraceptives Estrogen replacement therapy Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine Shingles can lead to pain in the breast as there is a painful blistering rash that appears on the skin of your breasts.",,"If you have painful breasts, the following may help: Take medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen Use heat or ice on the breast Wear a well-fitting bra that supports your breasts, such as a sports bra There is no good evidence to show that reducing the amount of fat, caffeine, or chocolate in your diet helps reduce breast pain. Vitamin E, thiamine, magnesium, and evening primrose oil are not harmful, but most studies have not shown any benefit. Talk to your provider before starting any medicine or supplement.

Children can have breath-holding spells when they are responding to: Fear Pain Traumatic event Being startled or confronted Breath-holding spells are more common in children with: Genetic conditions, such as Riley-Day syndrome or Rett syndrome Iron deficiency anemia A family history of breath-holding spells (parents may have had similar spells when they were children)","Breath-holding spells most often occur when a child becomes suddenly upset or surprised. The child makes a short gasp, exhales, and stops breathing. The child's nervous system slows the heart rate or breathing for a short amount of time. Breath- holding spells are not thought to be a willful act of defiance, even though they often occur with temper tantrums . Symptoms can include: Blue (cyanosis) or pale skin Crying, then no breathing Fainting or loss of alertness (unconsciousness) Jerky movements (short, seizure-like movements) Normal breathing starts again after a brief period of unconsciousness. The child's color improves with the first breath. This may occur several times per day, or only on rare occasions.",,
Breathing - slowed or stopped,Breathing that stops from any cause is called apnea. Slowed breathing is called bradypnea.

Breathing difficulty,Breathing difficulty may involve:,"Shortness of breath has many different causes. For example, heart disease can cause breathlessness if your heart is unable to pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. If your brain, muscles, or other body organs do not get enough oxygen, a sense of breathlessness may occur. Breathing difficulty may also be due to problems with the lungs, airways, or other health problems. Problems with the lungs: Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs ( pulmonary embolism ) Swelling and mucus buildup in the smallest air passages in the lungs ( bronchiolitis ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema Pneumonia High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) Other lung disease Problems with the airways leading to the lungs: Blockage of the air passages in your nose, mouth, or throat Choking on something stuck in the airways Swelling around the vocal cords ( croup ) Inflammation of the tissue (epiglottis) that covers the windpipe ( epiglottitis ) Problems with the heart: Chest pain due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart ( angina ) Heart attack Heart defects from birth ( congenital heart disease ) Heart failure Heart rhythm disturbances ( arrhythmias ) Other causes: Allergies (such as to mold, dander, or pollen) High altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air Compression of the chest wall Dust in the environment Emotional distress, such as anxiety Hiatal hernia (condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest) Obesity Panic attacks Anemia (low hemoglobin) Blood problems (when your blood cells cannot pick up oxygen normally; the disease methemoglobinemia is an example) Neuromuscular problems leading to weakness of the breathing muscles",,"Sometimes, mild breathing difficulty may be normal and is not a cause for concern. A very stuffy nose is one example. Strenuous exercise, especially when you do not exercise often, is another example. If breathing difficulty is new or is getting worse, it may be due to a serious problem. Though many causes are not dangerous and are easily treated, contact your health care provider for any breathing difficulty. If you are being treated for a long-term problem with your lungs or heart, follow your provider's directions to help with that problem.",Shortness of breath; Breathlessness; Difficulty breathing; Dyspnea

Brief psychotic disorder,"Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden, short-term display of psychotic behavior, such as hallucinations or delusions, which occurs with a stressful event.","Brief psychotic disorder is triggered by extreme stress, such as a traumatic accident or loss of a loved one. It is followed by a return to the previous level of function. The person may or may not be aware of the strange behavior. This condition most often affects people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Those who have personality disorders are at high risk of having a brief reactive psychosis.","Symptoms of brief psychotic disorder may include the following: Behavior that is odd or out of character False ideas about what is taking place (delusions) Hearing or seeing things that aren't real (hallucinations) Strange speech or language The symptoms are not due to alcohol or other illegal drug use, and they last longer than a day, but less than a month.",,Brief reactive psychosis; Psychosis - brief psychotic disorder
Brief resolved unexplained event - BRUE,"A brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) is when an infant younger than one year stops breathing, has a change in muscle tone, turns pale or blue in color, or is unresponsive. The event occurs suddenly, lasts less than 30 to 60 seconds, and is frightening to the person caring for the infant.","It is unclear how often these events occur. BRUE is not the same as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is also not the same as older terms such as near-miss SIDS or aborted crib deaths, which are no longer used. Events that involve a change in an infant's breathing, color, muscle tone, or behavior may be caused by an underlying medical problem. But these events would then not be considered a BRUE. Some of the causes for events that are not a BRUE include: Reflux after eating Severe infections (such as bronchiolitis , whooping cough ) Birth defects that involve the face, throat, or neck Birth defects of the heart or lungs Allergic reactions A brain, nerve, or muscle disorder Child abuse Certain uncommon genetic disorders A specific cause of the event is found about half the time. In healthy children who only have one event, the cause is rarely identified. The main risk factors for BRUE are: A prior episode when the child stopped breathing, turned pale, or had blue coloring Feeding problems Recent head cold or bronchitis Age younger than 10 weeks Low birth weight, being born early, or secondhand smoke exposure also may be risk factors.","These events are more likely to occur during the first two months of life and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. A BRUE includes one or more of the following: Breathing changes -- either no effort at breathing, breathing with great difficulty, or decreased breathing Color change -- most often blue or pale (many infants turn red, when crying for example, so this does not indicate a BRUE) Change in muscle tone -- most often they are limp, but they may become rigid Change in level of responsiveness Choking or gagging means the event was likely not a BRUE. These symptoms are more likely caused by reflux.",,Apparent life-threatening event; ALTE

Bronchiectasis,Bronchiectasis is a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged. This causes the airways to become permanently wider.,"Bronchiectasis is often caused by inflammation or infection of the airways that keeps coming back. Sometimes it begins in childhood after having a severe lung infection or inhaling a foreign object . Breathing in food particles can also lead to this condition. Other causes of bronchiectasis can include: Cystic fibrosis , a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease Allergic lung diseases Leukemia and related cancers Immune deficiency syndromes Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease) Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria As a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans Asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease (uncommon)","Symptoms develop over time. They may occur months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis. Long-term (chronic) cough with large amounts of foul smelling sputum is the main symptom of bronchiectasis.

Bronchiolitis,Bronchiolitis is swelling and mucus buildup in the smallest air passages in the lungs (bronchioles). It is usually due to a viral infection.,"Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months. It is a common, and sometimes severe illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. More than half of all infants are exposed to this virus by their first birthday. Other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include: Adenovirus Influenza Parainfluenza The virus is spread to infants by coming into direct contact with nose and throat fluids of someone who has the illness. This can happen when another child or an adult who has a virus: Sneezes or coughs nearby and tiny droplets in the air are then breathed in by the infant Touches toys or other objects that are then touched by the infant Bronchiolitis occurs more often in the fall and winter than other times of the year. It is a very common reason for infants to be hospitalized during winter and early spring. Risk factors of bronchiolitis include: Being around cigarette smoke Being younger than 6 months old Living in crowded conditions Not being breastfed Being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy","Some children have few or mild symptoms. Bronchiolitis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection. Within 2 to 3 days, the child develops more breathing problems, including wheezing and a cough. Symptoms include: Bluish skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) - emergency treatment is needed Breathing difficulty including wheezing and shortness of breath Cough Fatigue Fever Muscles around the ribs sink in as the child tries to breathe in (called intercostal retractions ) Infant's nostrils get wide when breathing Rapid breathing (tachypnea)",,Respiratory syncytial virus - bronchiolitis; Flu - bronchiolitis; Wheezing - bronchiolitis
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a long-term (chronic) lung condition that affects newborn babies who were either put on a breathing machine (ventilator) after birth or were born very early (prematurely).,"BPD occurs in very ill infants who received high levels of oxygen for a long period. BPD can also occur in infants who were on a breathing machine. BPD is more common in infants born early, whose lungs were not fully developed at birth. Risk factors include: Congenital heart disease (problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth) Prematurity, usually in infants born before 32 weeks gestation Severe respiratory or lung infection Risk of severe BPD has decreased in recent years.",Symptoms may include any of the following: Bluish skin color (cyanosis) Cough Rapid breathing Shortness of breath,,BPD; Chronic lung disease - children; CLD - children

Symptoms may include: Chills Itching General ill-feeling or discomfort Fever Nausea Reddish or purplish color in a circle around bite Sweating Large sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite Rarely, these symptoms may occur: Coma (lack of responsiveness) Blood in urine Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Kidney failure Seizures In serious cases, blood supply is cut off from the area of the bite. This results in black tissue scarring (eschar) at the site. The eschar sloughs off after about 2 to 5 weeks, leaving an ulcer through skin and fatty tissue. The ulcer may take many months to heal and leave a deep scar.","Seek emergency medical treatment right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or poison control. Follow these steps until medical help is given: Clean the area with soap and water. Wrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage. Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.

The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised. For example, a deep thigh bruise is painful when you walk or run. Eventually, the bruise changes to a bluish color, then greenish-yellow, and finally returns to the normal skin color as it heals.",,Contusion; Hematoma
Bruxism,Bruxism is when you grind your teeth (slide your teeth back and forth over each other).,People can clench and grind without being aware of it. It can happen during the day and night. Bruxism during sleep is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control. There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench or grind their teeth and never feel symptoms. Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include: How much stress you have How long and how tightly you clench and grind your teeth Whether your teeth are misaligned Your posture Your ability to relax Your diet Your sleeping habits,"Grinding your teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause temporomandibular joint problems (TMJ). Grinding can wear down your teeth. It can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners. Symptoms of bruxism include: Anxiety, stress, and tension Depression Earache (partly because the structures of the temporomandibular joint are very close to the ear canal, and because you can feel pain in a different location than its source; this is called referred pain) Eating disorders Headache Muscle tenderness, especially in the morning Hot, cold, or sweet sensitivity in the teeth Insomnia Sore or painful jaw",,Teeth grinding; Clenching

Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis,"Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) arthritis is a joint disease that can cause attacks of arthritis. Like gout, crystals form in the joints. But in this arthritis, the crystals are not formed from uric acid.","Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) causes this form of arthritis . The buildup of this chemical forms crystals in the cartilage of joints. This leads to attacks of joint swelling and pain most often in the knees, wrists, ankles, and shoulders. Other joints can be affected as well. In contrast to gout, the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe is not affected. Among older adults, CPPD is a common cause of sudden (acute) arthritis in one joint. The attack may be caused by: Injury to the joint Medical stress CPPD arthritis mainly affects the elderly because joint degeneration and osteoarthritis increases with age. Such joint damage increases the tendency of CPPD deposition. However, CPPD arthritis is also more common in people with: Hemochromatosis Parathyroid gland disease Dialysis-dependent renal failure","In most cases, CPPD deposits do not cause any symptoms.

Canavan disease,Canavan disease is a condition that affects how the body breaks down and uses aspartic acid.,"Canavan disease is passed down (inherited) through families. It is more common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population. The lack of the enzyme aspartoacylase leads to a buildup of material called N-acetylaspartic acid in the brain. This causes the white matter of the brain to break down. There are two forms of the disease: Neonatal (infantile) -- This is the most common form. Symptoms are severe. Babies seem to be normal the first few months after birth. By 3 to 5 months, they have developmental problems, such as those mentioned below under the Symptoms section of this article. Juvenile -- This is a less common form. Symptoms are mild. Developmental problems are less severe than those of the neonatal form. In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go undiagnosed as Canavan disease.","Symptoms often begin in the first year of life. Parents tend to notice it when their child is not reaching certain developmental milestones, including head control. Symptoms include: Abnormal posture with flexed arms and straight legs Food material flows back into the nose Feeding problems Increasing head size Irritability Poor muscle tone , especially of the neck muscles A lack of head control when baby is pulled from a lying to a sitting position Poor visual tracking, or blindness Reflux (gastrointestinal) with vomiting Seizures Severe intellectual disability Swallowing difficulties",,Spongy degeneration of the brain; Aspartoacylase deficiency; Canavan - van Bogaert disease
Cancer,Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. Cancerous cells are also called malignant cells.,"Cancer grows out of cells in the body. Normal cells multiply when the body needs them, and die when they are damaged or the body doesn't need them. Cancer occurs when the genetic material of a cell becomes changed. This results in cells growing out of control. Cells divide too quickly and do not die in a normal way. There are many kinds of cancer. Cancer can develop in almost any organ or tissue, such as the lung, colon, breast, skin, bones, or nerve tissue. There are many risk factors for cancer, including: Smoking tobacco or other substances Chewing tobacco Benzene and other chemical exposures Drinking too much alcohol Environmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of mold that can grow on peanut plants and produce a toxin called aflatoxin Genetic problems Obesity Radiation exposure Too much sunlight exposure Viruses The cause of many cancers remains unknown. The most common cause of cancer-related death is lung cancer. In the United States, skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. In US men, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Prostate cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer In US women, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Breast cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Some cancers are more common in certain parts of the world. For example, in Japan, there are many cases of stomach cancer . But in the United States this type of cancer is much less common. Differences in diet or environmental factors may play a role. Some other types of cancer include: Brain cancer Cervical cancer Hodgkin lymphoma Kidney cancer Leukemia Liver cancer Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Ovarian cancer Pancreatic cancer Testicular cancer Thyroid cancer Uterine cancer","Symptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the cancer. For example, lung cancer can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Colon cancer may cause diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool. Some cancers may not have any symptoms. In certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage.

Candida auris infection,Candida auris (C auris) is a type of yeast (fungus). It can cause a severe infection in hospital or nursing home patients. These people are often already very sick.,"Some people carry C auris on their bodies without it making them sick. This is called ""colonization."" This means they can easily spread the germ without knowing it. However, people who are colonized with C auris are still at risk for getting an infection from the fungus. C auris can be spread from person-to-person or from contact with objects or equipment. People in hospitals and people living long-term in nursing homes can be colonized with C auris . They can spread it to objects in the facility, such as bedside tables and handrails. Health care providers and visiting family and friends who have contact with a person with C auris can spread it to other people in the facility. Once C auris enters the body, it can cause a severe infection of the bloodstream and organs. This is more likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system. People who have breathing or feeding tubes or IV catheters are at the highest risk of infection. Other risk factors for C auris infection include: Living in a nursing home or making many visits to the hospital Taking antibiotic or antifungal medicines often Having many medical problems Having had a recent surgery C auris infections have occurred in people of all ages.","C auris infections can be hard to identity for the following reasons: Symptoms of a C auris infection are similar to those caused by other fungal infections. People who have a C auris infection are often already very sick. Symptoms of infection are hard to tell apart from other symptoms. C auris can be mistaken for other types of fungus unless special lab tests are used to identify it. High fever with chills that does not get better after taking antibiotics may be a sign of a C auris infection.

Candida infection of the skin,Candida infection of the skin is a yeast infection of the skin. The medical name of the condition is cutaneous candidiasis.,"The body normally hosts a variety of germs, including bacteria and fungi. Some of these are useful to the body, some produce no harm or benefit, and some can cause harmful infections. Some fungal infections are caused by fungi that often live on the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. They include yeast-like fungi such as candida. Sometimes, these yeast penetrate beneath the surface of the skin and cause infection. In cutaneous candidiasis, the skin is infected with candida fungi. This type of infection is fairly common. It can involve almost any skin on the body, but most often it occurs in warm, moist, creased areas such as the armpits and groin. The fungus that most often causes cutaneous candidiasis is Candida albicans . Candida is the most common cause of diaper rash in infants. The fungi take advantage of the warm, moist conditions inside the diaper. Candida infection is also particularly common in people with diabetes and in those who are obese. Antibiotics, steroid therapy, and chemotherapy increase the risk of cutaneous candidiasis. Candida can also cause infections of the nails, edges of the nails, and corners of the mouth. Oral thrush, a form of candida infection of the moist lining of the mouth, usually occurs when people take antibiotics though only a small number of people who take antibiotics get thrush. It may also be a sign of an HIV infection or other weakened immune system disorders when it occurs in adults. Individuals with candida infections are not usually contagious, though in some settings people with weakened immune systems may catch the infection. When it occurs in the mouth or vagina, it is sometimes called mucocutaneous candidiasis. Candida is also the most frequent cause of vaginal yeast infections. These infections are common and often occur with antibiotic use.","Candida infection of the skin can cause intense itching. Symptoms also include: Red, growing skin rash Rash on the skin folds, genitals, middle of the body, buttocks, under the breasts, and other areas of skin Infection of the hair follicles that may look like pimples",,Skin infection - fungal; Fungal infection - skin; Skin infection - yeast; Yeast infection - skin; Intertriginous candidiasis; Cutaneous candidiasis

Caput succedaneum,Caput succedaneum is swelling of the scalp in a newborn. It is most often brought on by pressure from the uterus or vaginal wall during a head-first (vertex) delivery.,"A caput succedaneum is more likely to form during a long or hard delivery. It is more common after the membranes have broken. This is because the fluid in the amniotic sac is no longer providing a cushion for the baby's head. Vacuum extraction done during a difficult birth can also increase the chances of a caput succedaneum. A caput succedaneum may be detected by prenatal ultrasound, even before labor or delivery begins. It has been found as early as 31 weeks of pregnancy. Very often, this is due to an early rupture of the membranes or too little amniotic fluid. It is less likely that a caput will form if the membranes stay intact.","Symptoms may include: Soft, puffy swelling on the scalp of a newborn infant Possible bruising or color change on the scalp swelling area Swelling that may extend to both sides of the scalp Swelling that is most often seen on the portion of the head which presented first",,Caput

Carbon monoxide poisoning,Carbon monoxide is an odorless gas that causes thousands of deaths each year in North America. Breathing in carbon monoxide is very dangerous. It is the leading cause of poisoning death in the United States.,,"When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poison replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream. Your heart, brain, and body then become starved of oxygen. Symptoms vary from person to person. Those at high risk for more severe bodily damage include young children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease, people who are at high altitudes, and smokers. Carbon monoxide can harm a fetus (unborn baby still in the womb). Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include: Breathing problems, including no breathing, shortness of breath , or rapid breathing Chest pain (may occur suddenly in people with angina ) Coma Confusion Convulsions Dizziness Drowsiness Fainting Fatigue General weakness and achiness Headache Hyperactivity Impaired judgment Irritability Low blood pressure Muscle weakness Rapid or abnormal heartbeat Shock Nausea and vomiting Unconsciousness Animals can also be poisoned by carbon monoxide. People who have pets at home may notice that their animals become weak or unresponsive from carbon monoxide exposure. Often the pets will get sick before humans. Since many of these symptoms can occur with viral illnesses, carbon monoxide poisoning is often confused with these conditions. This can lead to a delay in getting help.","If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air. Seek immediate medical right away. PREVENTION Install a carbon monoxide detector on each floor of your home. Place an additional detector near any major gas-burning appliances (such as a furnace or water heater). Many carbon monoxide poisonings occur in the winter months when furnaces, gas fireplaces, and portable heaters are being used and windows are closed. Have heaters and gas-burning appliances regularly inspected to make sure they are safe to use.",
Carbuncle,"A carbuncle is a skin infection that often involves a group of hair follicles. The infected material forms a lump, which occurs deep in the skin and often contains pus.","Most carbuncles are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ( S aureus ). A carbuncle is a cluster of several skin boils ( furuncles ). The infected mass is filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue. Fluid may drain out of the carbuncle, but sometimes the mass is so deep that it cannot drain on its own. Carbuncles can develop anywhere. But they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women. The bacteria that cause this condition spread easily. So, family members may develop carbuncles at the same time. Often, the cause of a carbuncle cannot be determined. You are more likely to get a carbuncle if you have: Friction from clothing or shaving Poor hygiene Poor overall health People with diabetes, dermatitis, and a weakened immune system are more likely to develop staph infections that can cause carbuncles. Staph bacteria are sometimes found in the nose or around the genitals. Carbuncles can recur when antibiotics are not able to treat the bacteria in those areas.","A carbuncle is a swollen lump or mass under the skin. It may be the size of a pea or as large as a golf ball. The carbuncle may be red and irritated and might hurt when you touch it. A carbuncle usually: Develops over several days Have a white or yellow center (contains pus) Weep, ooze, or crust Spread to other skin areas Sometimes, other symptoms may occur.

These tumors are rare, and often slow growing. Most carcinoid tumors are found in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. Carcinoid syndrome occurs in very few people with carcinoid tumors, after the tumor has spread to the liver or lung. These tumors release too much of the hormone serotonin , as well as several other chemicals. The hormones cause the blood vessels to open (dilate). This causes carcinoid syndrome.","The carcinoid syndrome is made up of four main symptoms including: Flushing (face, neck, or upper chest), or widened blood vessels seen on the skin ( telangiectasias ) Difficulty breathing, such as wheezing Diarrhea Heart problems, such as leaking heart valves, slow heartbeat, low or high blood pressure Symptoms are sometimes brought on by physical exertion, or eating or drinking things such as blue cheese, chocolate, or red wine.",,Flush syndrome; Argentaffinoma syndrome

Cardiac amyloidosis,Cardiac amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue. These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly.,"Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloid build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis (""stiff heart syndrome"") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of restrictive cardiomyopathy . Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats ( arrhythmias ) and faulty heart signals (heart block). The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.","Some people may have no symptoms.

Cardiac arrest,"Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating. When this happens, blood flow to the brain and the rest of the body also stops. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is not treated within a few minutes, cardiac arrest most often causes death.","While some people refer to a heart attack as a cardiac arrest, they are not the same thing. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery stops the flow of blood to the heart. The medical term for this is myocardial infarction. A heart attack can damage the heart, but it does not necessarily cause death. However, a heart attack can sometimes trigger a cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system, such as: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) -- When VF occurs, the lower chambers in the heart quiver instead of beating regularly. The heart cannot pump blood, which results in cardiac arrest. This can happen without any cause or as a result of another condition. Heart block -- This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart. Problems that may lead to cardiac arrest include: Coronary heart disease (CHD) -- CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, so the blood cannot flow smoothly. Over time, this can put a strain on your heart's muscle and electrical system. Heart attack -- A prior heart attack can create scar tissue that can lead to VF and cardiac arrest. Heart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart can also lead to cardiac arrest. Abnormal levels of potassium or magnesium -- These minerals help your heart's electrical system work. Abnormally high or low levels can cause cardiac arrest. Severe physical stress -- Anything that causes a severe stress on your body can lead to cardiac arrest. This can include trauma, electrical shock, or major blood loss. Recreational drugs -- Using certain drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, also increases your risk for cardiac arrest. Medicines -- Some medicines can increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms.","Most people do not have any symptoms of cardiac arrest until it happens. Symptoms may include: Sudden loss of consciousness; a person will fall to the floor or slump down if sitting No pulse No breathing In some cases, you may notice some symptoms about an hour before cardiac arrest.

Cardiac tamponade,Cardiac tamponade is pressure on the heart that occurs when blood or fluid builds up in the space between the heart muscle and the outer covering sac (pericardium) of the heart.,"In this condition, blood or fluid collects in the sac surrounding the heart. This prevents the heart ventricles from expanding fully. The excess pressure from the fluid prevents the heart from working properly. As a result, the body does not get enough blood. Cardiac tamponade can occur due to: Dissecting aortic aneurysm (thoracic) End-stage lung cancer Heart attack ( acute MI ) Heart surgery Pericarditis caused by bacterial or viral infections Wounds to the heart Other possible causes include: Heart tumors Underactive thyroid gland Kidney failure Leukemia Placement of central lines Radiation therapy to the chest Recent invasive heart procedures Systemic lupus erythematosus Dermatomyositis Heart failure Cardiac tamponade due to disease occurs in about 2 out of 10,000 people.","Symptoms may include: Anxiety , restlessness Breathing problems Sharp chest pain that is felt in the neck, shoulder, back, or abdomen Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing Problems breathing Discomfort, sometimes relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward Fainting , lightheadedness Pale, gray, or blue skin Palpitations Rapid breathing Swelling of the legs or abdomen Jaundice Other symptoms that may occur with this disorder: Dizziness Drowsiness Weak or absent pulse",,Tamponade; Pericardial tamponade; Pericarditis - tamponade
Cardiogenic shock,Cardiogenic shock takes place when the heart is unable to supply enough blood and oxygen to the organs of the body.,"The most common causes of cardiogenic shock are serious heart conditions. Many of these occur during or after a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These complications include: A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack Dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , or supraventricular tachycardia Pressure on the heart due to a buildup of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade) Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers) Very slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block) Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to supply as much blood as the body needs. It can happen even if there hasn't been a heart attack. For example, if one of these problems listed above occurs and your heart function drops suddenly. Or if a valve becomes obstructed or if a combination of problems occurs.","Symptoms include: Chest pain or pressure Coma Decreased urination Fast breathing Fast pulse Heavy sweating , moist skin Lightheadedness Loss of alertness and ability to concentrate Restlessness, agitation , confusion Shortness of breath Skin that feels cool to the touch Pale skin color or blotchy skin Weak (thready) pulse",,Shock - cardiogenic
Cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy is disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem. It often contributes to the heart's inability to pump or function well.","There are many types of cardiomyopathy, with different causes. Some of the more common ones are: Dilated cardiomyopathy (also called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy if there is no known cause) is a condition in which the heart becomes weak and the chambers get large. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood out to the body. It can be caused by many medical problems. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for blood to leave the heart. This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward.",,,

Carotid artery disease,Carotid artery disease causes the carotid arteries to become narrowed or blocked.,"Carotid artery disease occurs when fatty material called plaque builds up inside the arteries. This buildup of plaque is called hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). The plaque may slowly block or narrow the carotid artery. Or it may cause a clot to form suddenly. A clot that blocks the artery enough to reduce blood flow can lead to stroke . Risk factors for blockage or narrowing of the arteries include: Smoking (people who smoke one pack a day double their risk for stroke) Diabetes High blood pressure High cholesterol and triglycerides Older age Family history of stroke or blood vessel disorder Alcohol use Recreational drug use Trauma to the neck area, which may cause a tear in the carotid artery Radiation therapy to the neck","At early stages, you may not have any symptoms. After plaque builds up, the first symptoms of carotid artery disease may be a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain that doesn't cause any lasting damage.

Carpal tunnel syndrome,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which there is excessive pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. This is the nerve that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers.","The median nerve typically provides feeling and movement to the thumb side of the hand. This includes the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of the ring finger. The area in your wrist where the nerve enters the hand is called the carpal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. Any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called carpal tunnel syndrome. Some people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome were born with a small carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by making the same hand and wrist motion over and over. Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Studies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60. It is more common in women than men. Other factors that may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include: Alcohol use Bone fractures and arthritis of the wrist Cyst or tumor that grows in the wrist Infections Obesity Extra fluids retained during pregnancy or menopause Rheumatoid arthritis Diseases that have abnormal deposits of protein in the body ( amyloidosis )",Symptoms may include any of the following: Clumsiness of the hand when gripping objects Numbness or tingling or tingling in the thumb and next two or three fingers of one or both hands Numbness or tingling of the palm of the hand Pain that extends to the elbow Pain in the wrist or hand in one or both hands Problems with fine finger movements (coordination) in one or both hands Wasting away of the muscle under the thumb (in advanced or long-term cases) Weak grip or difficulty carrying bags (a common complaint) Weakness in one or both hands,,Median nerve dysfunction; Median nerve entrapment; Median neuropathy

It also can be spread through contact with cat saliva on broken skin or mucosal surfaces like those in the nose, mouth, and eyes.","A person who has had contact with an infected cat may show symptoms, including: Bump ( papule ) or blister ( pustule ) at site of injury (usually the first sign) Fatigue Fever (in some people) Headache Lymph node swelling ( lymphadenopathy ) near the site of the scratch or bite Overall discomfort ( malaise ) Less common symptoms may include: Loss of appetite Sore throat Weight loss",,CSD; Cat-scratch fever; Bartonellosis
Cataract - adult,A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye.,"The lens of the eye is normally clear. It acts like the lens on a camera, focusing light as it passes to the back of the eye. Until a person is around age 45, the shape of the lens is able to change. This allows the lens to focus on an object, whether it is close or far away. As a person ages, proteins in the lens begin to break down. This makes the lens less flexible so that it is harder to focus on near objects. Over time, the lens becomes cloudy. What the eye sees may appear blurry at all distances. This condition is known as a cataract. Factors that may speed cataract formation are: Diabetes Eye inflammation Eye injury Family history of cataracts Long-term use of corticosteroids (taken by mouth) or certain other medicines Radiation exposure Smoking Surgery for another eye problem Too much exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight)","Watch this video about: Cataract Cataracts develop slowly and painlessly. Vision in the affected eye slowly gets worse. Mild clouding of the lens often occurs after age 60. But it may not cause any vision problems. By age 75, most people have cataracts that affect their vision. Problems with seeing may include: Being sensitive to glare Cloudy, fuzzy, foggy, or filmy vision Difficulty seeing at night or in dim light Double vision Loss of color intensity Problems seeing shapes against a background or the difference between shades of colors Seeing halos around lights Frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions Cataracts lead to decreased vision, even in daylight. Most people with cataracts have similar changes in both eyes, though one eye may be worse than the other.

Celiac disease – sprue,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that damages the lining of the small intestine. This damage comes from a reaction to eating gluten. This is a substance that is found in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. It is also found in food made from these ingredients.","The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number of symptoms and other health problems. The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood. People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Europeans.

Central diabetes insipidus,Central diabetes insipidus is a rare condition that involves extreme thirst and excessive urination.,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water. DI is a different disease than diabetes , though both share common symptoms of excessive urination and thirst. Central diabetes insipidus is a form of DI that occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin . ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus . ADH is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain. ADH controls the amount of water excreted in urine. Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. This results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (10 to 15 liters a day). The reduced level of ADH may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. This damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation, tumor , or injury to the brain . In rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem.","Symptoms of central diabetes insipidus include: Increased urine production Excessive thirst Confusion and changes in alertness due to dehydration and higher than normal sodium level in the body, if the person is unable to drink",,Diabetes insipidus - central; Neurogenic diabetes insipidus

Stress appears to be a risk factor. Early studies found that people with aggressive, ""type A"" personalities who are under a lot of stress may be more likely to develop central serous choroidopathy. This condition can also occur as a complication of steroid drug use. It has recently been reported after vaccination for COVID-19, although cause and effect could not be proven.",Symptoms may include: Dim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision Distortion of straight lines with the affected eye Objects appearing smaller or farther away with the affected eye,,Central serous retinopathy; Central serous chorioretinopathy
Central sleep apnea,Central sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing stops over and over during sleep.,"Central sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that cause breathing. The condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems. For example, it can develop in someone who has a problem with an area of the brain called the brainstem, which controls breathing. Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include: Problems that affect the brainstem, including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck) Certain medicines, such as narcotic painkillers Being at high altitude If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea. A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can affect people with severe heart failure and can be associated with central sleep apnea. The breathing pattern involves alternating deep and heavy breathing with shallow, or even not breathing, usually while sleeping. Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea . With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. Central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea can be present in the same person.","People with central sleep apnea have episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep. Other symptoms may include: Chronic fatigue Daytime sleepiness Morning headaches Restless sleep Other symptoms may occur if the apnea is due to a problem with the nervous system.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy,Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain. CAA causes bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) and dementia.,"People with CAA have deposits of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The protein is usually not deposited anywhere else in the body. The major risk factor is increasing age. CAA is more often seen in people older than 55. Sometimes, it is passed down through families.","CAA can cause bleeding into the brain. Bleeding often occurs in the outer parts of the brain, called the cortex, and not the deep areas. Symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Some people have gradual memory problems. When a CT scan is done, there are often signs that they have had bleeding in the brain that they may not have realized. If there is a lot of bleeding, immediate symptoms occur and resemble a stroke. These symptoms include: Drowsiness Headache (usually in a certain part of the head) Nervous system changes that may start suddenly, including confusion , delirium , double vision , decreased vision, sensation changes, speech problems, weakness , or paralysis Seizures Stupor or coma (rarely) Vomiting If bleeding is not severe or widespread, symptoms can include: Episodes of confusion Headaches that come and go Loss of mental function (dementia) Weakness or unusual sensations that come and go, and involve smaller areas Seizures",,Amyloidosis - cerebral; CAA; Congophilic angiopathy

Cerebral arteriovenous malformation,A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth.,"The exact cause of cerebral AVM is unknown, however growing evidence suggests a genetic cause. An AVM occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal small vessels (capillaries) between them. AVMs vary in size and location in the brain. An AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to the blood vessel. This allows blood to leak (hemorrhage) into the brain or surrounding tissues and reduces blood flow to the brain. Cerebral AVMs are rare. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life. Some people with an AVM also have brain aneurysms .","In about one half of people with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. Symptoms of an AVM that is bleeding are: Confusion Ear noise/buzzing (also called pulsatile tinnitus) Headache in one or more parts of the head, may seem like a migraine Problems walking Seizures Symptoms due to pressure on one area of the brain include: Vision problems Dizziness Muscle weakness in an area of the body or face Numbness in an area of the body",,AVM - cerebral; Arteriovenous hemangioma; Stroke - AVM; Hemorrhagic stroke - AVM
Cerebral hypoxia,Cerebral hypoxia occurs when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain. The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function.,"In cerebral hypoxia, sometimes only the oxygen supply is interrupted. This can be caused by: Breathing in smoke (smoke inhalation), such as during a fire Carbon monoxide poisoning Choking Diseases that prevent movement (paralysis) of the breathing muscles, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) High altitude exposure Pressure on (compression) the windpipe (trachea) Strangulation In other cases, both oxygen and nutrient supply are stopped, caused by: Cardiac arrest (when the heart stops pumping) Cardiac arrhythmia (heart rhythm problems) Complications of general anesthesia Drowning Illegal drug or medicine overdose Injuries to a newborn that occurred before, during, or soon after birth, such as cerebral palsy Prolonged seizure (status epilepticus) Stroke Very low blood pressure Brain cells are very sensitive to a lack of oxygen. Some brain cells start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears. As a result, brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or death.",Symptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include: Change in attention (inattentiveness) Poor judgment Speech disorder Uncoordinated movement Symptoms of severe cerebral hypoxia include: Complete unawareness and unresponsiveness ( coma ) No breathing No response of the pupils of the eye to light,,Hypoxic encephalopathy; Anoxic encephalopathy
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that involve the brain. This affects nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking.","CP is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing. In some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen ( hypoxia ) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs. Premature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as: Bleeding in the brain Brain infections ( encephalitis , meningitis , herpes simplex infections) Head injury Infections in the mother during pregnancy ( rubella ) Untreated jaundice Injuries to the brain during the childbirth process Exposure to toxins while developing (mercury) In some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.","Symptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may: Be very mild or very severe Only involve one side of the body or both sides Be more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs Symptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking. There are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms. Spastic CP is the most common type. Symptoms include: Muscles that are very tight and do not stretch. They may tighten even more over time. Abnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make ""scissors"" movements, walk on the toes. Joints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture). Muscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis). Symptoms may affect one arm or leg, one side of the body, both legs, or both arms and legs. The following symptoms may occur in other types of CP: Abnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stress Tremors Unsteady gait Loss of coordination Floppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much Other brain and nervous system symptoms may include: Learning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normal Speech problems (dysarthria) Hearing or vision problems Seizures Pain, especially in adults, which can be difficult to manage Eating and digestion symptoms: Difficulty sucking or feeding in infants, or chewing and swallowing in older children and adults Vomiting or constipation Other symptoms: Increased drooling Slower than normal growth Irregular breathing Urinary incontinence",,Spastic paralysis; Paralysis - spastic; Spastic hemiplegia; Spastic diplegia; Spastic quadriplegia

Cervical cancer,Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.,"Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the widespread use of Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer and conditions that may become cervical cancer. Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar (gland cells). Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia . This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap tests, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap test results. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and also by sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical as well as other cancers. Other strains can cause genital warts . Others do not cause any problems at all. A woman's sexual behavior can increase her risk for developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include: Having sex at an early age Having multiple sexual partners Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities Other risk factors for cervical cancer include: Not getting the HPV vaccine Being economically disadvantaged Having a mother who took the medicine diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage Having a weakened immune system","Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods , after intercourse, or after menopause Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual Cervical cancer may spread to the vagina, lymph nodes, bladder, intestines, lungs, bones, and liver. Often, there are no problems or symptoms until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include: Abdominal pain Back pain Bone pain or fractures Fatigue Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina Leg pain Loss of appetite Pelvic pain Single swollen leg Weight loss",,Cancer - cervix; Cervical cancer - HPV; Cervical cancer - dysplasia

Cervical spondylosis,Cervical spondylosis is a disorder in which there is wear on the cartilage (disks) and bones of the neck (cervical vertebrae). It is a common cause of chronic neck pain.,"Cervical spondylosis is caused by aging and chronic wear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance. Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them. The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are: Being overweight and not exercising Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting Past neck injury (often several years before) Past spine surgery Ruptured or slipped disk Severe arthritis Previous surgery on the neck","Symptoms often develop slowly over time. But they may start or get worse suddenly. The pain may be mild, or it can be deep and so severe that you are unable to move. You may feel the pain over the shoulder blade. It may spread to the upper arm, forearm, or fingers (in rare cases). The pain may get worse: After standing or sitting At night When you sneeze, cough, or laugh When you bend the neck backward or twist your neck or walk more than a few yards (meters) You may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your health care provider examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your arm, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, clumsiness of your hand, or other problems. Other common symptoms are: Neck stiffness that gets worse over time Numbness or abnormal sensations in the shoulders or arms Headaches , especially in the back of the head Pain on the inside of the shoulder blade and shoulder pain Less common symptoms are: Loss of balance Pain or numbness in the legs Loss of control over the bladder or bowels (if there is pressure on the spinal cord)",,Cervical osteoarthritis; Arthritis - neck; Neck arthritis; Chronic neck pain; Degenerative disk disease
Cervicitis,Cervicitis is swelling or inflamed tissue of the end of the uterus (cervix).,"Cervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity.

It affects more than one half of all women at some point during their adult life. Causes include: High-risk sexual behavior History of STIs Many sexual partners Sexual intercourse at an early age Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI Too much growth of some bacteria that normally are present in the vagina ( bacterial vaginosis ) can also lead to cervical infection.","There may be no symptoms. If symptoms are present, these may include: Abnormal vaginal bleeding that occurs after intercourse, or between periods Unusual vaginal discharge that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in color Painful sexual intercourse Pain in the vagina Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis Painful urination Vaginal itching Women who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms.",,Cervical inflammation; Inflammation - cervix

It is spread by the bite of reduviid bugs, or kissing bugs, and is one of the major health problems in South America. Due to immigration, the disease also affects people in the United States. Risk factors for Chagas disease include: Living in a hut where reduviid bugs live in the walls Living in Central or South America Poverty Receiving a blood transfusion or an organ donation from a person who carries the parasite, but does not have active Chagas disease","Chagas disease has two phases: acute and chronic . The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, including: Fever General ill feeling Swelling of an eye if the bite is near the eye Swollen red area at site of the insect bite After the acute phase, the disease goes into remission. No other symptoms may appear for many years. When symptoms finally develop, they may include: Constipation Digestive problems Heart failure Pain in the abdomen Pounding or racing heart Swallowing difficulties",,Parasite infection - American trypanosomiasis
Chalazion,A chalazion is a small bump in the eyelid caused by a blockage of a tiny oil gland.,"A chalazion is caused by a blocked duct in one of the meibomian glands. These glands are located in the eyelid directly behind the eyelashes. They produce a thin, oily fluid that lubricates the eye.","A chalazion often develops following an internal hordeolum (also called a stye). The eyelid most often becomes tender, red, swollen and warm. Sometimes, the blocked gland causing the stye will not drain even though the redness and swelling go away. The gland will form a firm nodule in the eyelid that is not tender. This is called a chalazion.",,Meibomian gland lipogranuloma
Chancroid,Chancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact.,"Chancroid is caused by a bacterium called Haemophilus ducreyi . The infection is found in many parts of the world, such as Africa and southwest Asia. The infection is uncommon in the United States. Most people in the United States who are diagnosed with chancroid get it outside the country in areas where the infection is more common.","Within 1 day to 2 weeks after becoming infected, a person will get a small bump on the genitals. The bump becomes an ulcer within a day after it first appears. The ulcer: Ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 2 inches (3 millimeters to 5 centimeters) in diameter Is painful Is soft Has sharply defined borders Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material Has a base that bleeds easily if it is bumped or scraped About one half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women often have 4 or more ulcers. The ulcers appear in specific locations. Common locations in men are: Foreskin Groove behind the head of the penis Shaft of the penis Head of the penis Opening of the penis Scrotum In women, the most common location for ulcers is the outer lips of the vagina (labia majora). ""Kissing ulcers"" may develop. Kissing ulcers are those that occur on opposite surfaces of the labia. Ulcers also may form on the: Inner vagina lips (labia minora) Area between the genitals and the anus (perineal area) Inner thighs The most common symptoms in women are pain with urination and intercourse. The ulcer may look like the sore of primary syphilis (chancre). About one half of the people who are infected with a chancroid develop enlarged lymph nodes in the groin. In one half of people who have swelling of the groin lymph nodes, the nodes break through the skin and cause draining abscesses .

Charcot foot,"Charcot foot is a condition that affects the bones, joints, and soft tissue in the feet and ankles. It can develop as a result of nerve damage in the feet due to diabetes or other nerve injuries.","Charcot foot is a rare and disabling disorder. It is a result of nerve damage to the feet. A common cause is peripheral neuropathy . Diabetes is the most common cause of this type of nerve damage. This damage is more common in people with type 1 diabetes. When blood sugar levels are high over a long time, both nerve and blood vessel damage occurs in the arms and legs. Nerve damage makes it harder to notice the amount of pressure on the foot or if it is being stressed. The result is ongoing small injuries to the bones and ligaments that support the foot. You may develop bone stress fractures in your feet, yet never know it. Continuing to walk on the fractured bone often leads to further bone and joint damage. Other factors leading to foot damage include: Blood vessel damage from diabetes can increase or change blood flow to the feet. This can lead to bone loss. Weakened bones in the feet increase the risk of fracture. Injury to the foot signals the body to produce more inflammation-causing chemicals. This contributes to swelling and bone loss.","Early foot symptoms may include: Mild pain and discomfort Redness Swelling Warmth in the affected foot (noticeably warmer than the other foot) At later stages, bones in the foot break and move out of place, causing the foot or ankle to become deformed. A classic sign of Charcot is rocker-bottom foot. This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse. This causes the arch of the foot to collapse and bow downward. The toes may curl downward. Bones that stick out at odd angles can lead to pressure sores and foot ulcers . Because the feet are numb, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed. High blood sugar also makes it hard for the body to fight infection. As a result, these foot ulcers may become infected.",,Charcot joint; Neuropathic arthropathy; Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy; Charcot arthropathy; Charcot osteoarthropathy; Diabetic Charcot foot
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of disorders passed down through families that affect the nerves outside the brain and spine. These are called the peripheral nerves.,Charcot-Marie-Tooth is one of the most common nerve-related disorders passed down through families (inherited). Changes to any of at least 40 genes can cause different forms of this disease. The disease leads to damage or destruction to the covering ( myelin sheath) around nerve fibers.,"Nerves that stimulate movement (called the motor nerves) are most severely affected. The nerves in the legs are affected first and most severely. Symptoms most often begin between mid-childhood and early adulthood. They may include: Foot deformity (very high arch to feet) Foot drop (inability to point foot upward to hold it horizontal) Loss of lower leg muscle, which leads to skinny calves Numbness in the foot or leg ""Slapping"" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking) Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet Later, similar symptoms may appear in the arms and hands.

Charley horse,"A charley horse is the common name for a muscle spasm or cramp. Muscle spasms can occur in any muscle in the body, but often happen in the leg. When a muscle is in spasm, it contracts without your control and does not relax.",Muscle spasms often occur when a muscle is overused or injured. Things that might bring on a muscle spasm include: Exercising when you have not had enough fluids (you're dehydrated). Having low levels of minerals such as potassium or calcium. Some spasms occur because the nerve that connects to a muscle is irritated. One example is when a herniated disk irritates the spinal nerves and causes pain and spasm in the back muscles. Spasms in the calf often occur while kicking during swimming or running. They can also happen at night when you are in bed. Upper leg spasms are more common with running or jumping activities. Spasm in the neck (cervical spine) can be a sign of stress.,When a muscle goes into spasm it feels very tight. It is sometimes described as a knot. The pain can be severe.,,Muscle spasm
Chediak-Higashi syndrome,"Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare disease of the immune and nervous systems. It involves pale-colored hair, eyes, and skin.",Chediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease. Defects have been found in the LYST (also called CHS1 ) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.,"Children with this condition may have: Silver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism) Increased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes Jerky eye movements ( nystagmus ) Infection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer lymphoma called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Chemical pneumonitis,Chemical pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs or breathing difficulty due to inhaling chemical fumes or breathing in and choking on certain chemicals.,"Many chemicals used in the home and workplace can cause pneumonitis. Some common dangerous inhaled substances include: Chlorine gas (breathed in from cleaning materials such as chlorine bleach, during industrial accidents, or near swimming pools) Grain and fertilizer dust Noxious fumes from pesticides Smoke (from house fires and wildfires) There are two types of pneumonitis: Acute pneumonitis occurs suddenly after breathing in the substance. Long-term (chronic) pneumonitis occurs after exposure to low levels of the substance over a long time. This causes inflammation and may lead to stiffness of the lungs. As a result, the lungs start to lose their ability to get oxygen to the body. Untreated, this condition can cause respiratory failure and death. Chronic aspiration of acid from the stomach and exposure to chemical warfare can also lead to chemical pneumonitis.",Acute symptoms may include: Air hunger (feeling that you cannot get enough air) Breathing that sounds wet or gurgling (abnormal lung sounds) Cough Difficulty breathing Unusual sensation (possibly burning feeling) in the chest Chronic symptoms may include: Cough (may or may not occur) Progressive disability (related to shortness of breath) Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath with only mild exercise,,Aspiration pneumonia - chemical

Chest pain,Chest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel anywhere along the front of your body between your neck and upper abdomen.,"Heart or blood vessel problems that can cause chest pain: Angina or a heart attack. The most common symptom is chest pain that may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. The pain may spread to the arm, shoulder, jaw, or back. A tear in the wall of the aorta, the large blood vessel that takes blood from the heart to the rest of the body ( aortic dissection ) causes sudden, severe pain in the chest and upper back. Swelling (inflammation) in the sac that surrounds the heart ( pericarditis ) causes pain in the center part of the chest. Lung problems that can cause chest pain: A blood clot in the lung ( pulmonary embolism ). Collapse of the lung ( pneumothorax ). Pneumonia may cause a sharp chest pain that often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough. Swelling of the lining around the lung ( pleurisy ) can cause chest pain that usually feels sharp, and often gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough. Other causes of chest pain: Panic attack , which often occurs with fast breathing. Inflammation where the ribs join the breast bone or sternum ( costochondritis ). Shingles , which causes sharp, tingling pain on one side that stretches from the chest to the back, and may cause a rash. Strain of the muscles and tendons between the ribs. Chest pain can also be due to the following digestive system problems: Spasms or narrowing of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) Gallstones cause pain that gets worse after a meal (most often a fatty meal).

Chickenpox,Chickenpox is a viral infection in which a person develops very itchy blisters all over the body. It was more common in the past. The illness is rare today because of the chickenpox vaccine.,"Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults. Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox: From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases. Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox. Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.","Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears: Fever Headache Stomach ache The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin. The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp. After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids. Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria that is made more likely by scratching. Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.",,Varicella; Chicken pox

Bites commonly occur in the summer and fall months.",The main symptoms of chigger bites are: Severe itching Red pimple-like bumps or hives Itching usually occurs several hours after the chiggers attach to the skin. The bite is painless. A skin rash may appear on the parts of the body that were exposed to the sun. It may stop where the underwear meets the legs. This is often a clue that the rash is due to chigger bites.,,Harvest mite; Red mite
Child neglect and emotional abuse,"Neglect and emotional abuse can cause a child a lot of harm. It is often hard to see or prove this kind of abuse, so other people are less likely to help the child. When a child is being physically or sexually abused, emotional abuse is also often happening to the child.",,"EMOTIONAL ABUSE These are examples of emotional abuse: Not providing the child with a safe environment.

Typically, infants only breathe through their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying. Choanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need resuscitation at delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems. Symptoms include: Chest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying.

Chronic granulomatous disease,Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder in which certain immune system cells do not function properly. This leads to repeated and severe infections.,"In CGD, immune system cells called phagocytes are unable to kill some types of bacteria and fungi. This disorder leads to long-term ( chronic ) and repeated (recurrent) infections. The condition is often discovered very early in childhood. Milder forms may be diagnosed during the teenage years, or even in adulthood. Risk factors include a family history of recurrent or chronic infections. About half of CGD cases are passed down through families as a sex-linked recessive trait . This means that boys are more likely to get the disorder than girls. The defective gene is carried on the X chromosome. Boys have 1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome. If a boy has an X chromosome with the defective gene, he may inherit this condition. Girls have 2 X chromosomes. If a girl has 1 X chromosome with the defective gene, the other X chromosome may have a working gene to make up for it. A girl must inherit the defective X gene from each parent in order to have the disease.","CGD can cause many types of skin infections that are hard to treat, including: Blisters or sores on the face (impetigo) Eczema Growths filled with pus (abscesses) Pus-filled lumps in the skin (boils) CGD can also cause: Persistent diarrhea Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Lung infections, such as pneumonia or lung abscess",,CGD; Fatal granulomatosis of childhood; Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood; Progressive septic granulomatosis; Phagocyte deficiency - chronic granulomatous disease

These cells are found in the bone marrow and other parts of the body. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.,"The cause of CLL is unknown. There is no link to radiation exposure. It is unclear if certain chemicals can cause CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War has been linked to a slight increased risk for developing CLL. CLL usually affects older adults, especially those over age 60. People under age 45 rarely develop CLL. CLL is more common in white people than in people of other races. It is more common in men than in women. Some people with CLL have family members with the disease.","Symptoms usually develop slowly. CLL often does not cause symptoms at first. It may be found by blood tests done in people for other reasons. Symptoms of CLL may include: Enlarged lymph nodes , liver, or spleen Excessive sweating , night sweats Fatigue Fever Infections that keep coming back (recur), despite treatment Loss of appetite or becoming full too quickly (early satiety) Weight loss",,CLL; Leukemia - chronic lymphocytic (CLL); Blood cancer - chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Bone marrow cancer - chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Lymphoma - chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder,"Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is a condition that involves quick, uncontrollable movements or vocal outbursts (but not both).",Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is more common than Tourette syndrome . Chronic tics may be forms of Tourette syndrome. Tics usually start at age 5 or 6 and get worse until age 12. They often improve during adulthood.,"A tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound that has no reason or goal. Tics can involve: Excessive blinking Grimaces of the face Quick movements of the arms, legs, or other areas Sounds (grunts, throat clearing, contractions of the abdomen or diaphragm) Some people have many kinds of tics. People with the condition can hold off these symptoms for a short time. But they feel relief when they carry out these movements. They often describe the tics as a response to an inner urge. Some say they have abnormal sensations in the area of the tic before it occurs. Tics may continue during all stages of sleep, though may be less frequent. They may get worse with: Excitement Fatigue Heat Stress",,Chronic vocal tic disorder; Tic - chronic motor tic disorder; Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder; Chronic motor tic disorder
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is cancer that starts inside the bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.,The cause of CML is related to an abnormal chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome. Radiation exposure can increase the risk of developing CML. Radiation exposure can be from radiation treatments used in the past to treat thyroid cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma or from a nuclear disaster. It takes many years to develop leukemia from radiation exposure. Most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop leukemia. And most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation. CML most often occurs in middle-age adults and in children.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia is grouped into phases: Chronic Accelerated Blast crisis The chronic phase can last for months or years. The disease may have few or no symptoms during this time. Most people are diagnosed during this stage, when they have blood tests done for other reasons. The accelerated phase is a more dangerous phase. Leukemia cells grow more quickly. Common symptoms include fever (even without infection), bone pain , and a swollen spleen . Untreated CML leads to the blast crisis phase. Bleeding and infection may occur due to bone marrow failure. Other possible symptoms of a blast crisis include: Bruising Excessive sweating (night sweats) Fatigue Fever Pressure under the lower left ribs from a swollen spleen Rash -- small pinpoint red marks on the skin ( petechiae ) Weakness",,CML; Chronic myeloid leukemia; CGL; Chronic granulocytic leukemia; Leukemia - chronic granulocytic
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease. Having COPD makes it hard to breathe.,"Smoking is the main cause of COPD.

Chronic pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is swelling of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis is present when this problem does not heal or recurs and does not improve, gets worse over time, and leads to permanent damage.","The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. When scarring of the pancreas occurs, the organ is no longer able to make the right amount of these enzymes. As a result, your body may be unable to digest fat and key elements of food. Damage to the parts of the pancreas that make insulin may lead to diabetes mellitus. The condition is most often caused by alcohol abuse over many years. Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known or caused by gall stones. Other conditions that have been linked to chronic pancreatitis: Problems when the immune system attacks the body Blockage of the tubes (ducts) that drain enzymes from the pancreas Cystic fibrosis High levels of a fat, called triglycerides, in the blood Overactive parathyroid gland Use of certain medicines (especially sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine) Pancreatitis that is passed down in families (hereditary) Chronic pancreatitis is more common in men than in women. This often occurs in people ages 30 to 40.","Symptoms include: ABDOMINAL PAIN Greatest in the upper abdomen May last from hours to days; over time, may always be present May get worse from eating May get worse from drinking alcohol May also be felt in the back as if it is boring through the abdomen DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS Chronic weight loss, even when eating habits and amounts are normal.

Chronic subdural hematoma,"A chronic subdural hematoma is an ""old"" collection of blood and blood breakdown products between the surface of the brain and its outermost covering (the dura). The chronic phase of a subdural hematoma begins several weeks after the first bleeding.","A subdural hematoma develops when bridging veins tear and leak blood. These are the tiny veins that run between the dura and surface of the brain. This is usually the result of a head injury. A collection of blood then forms over the surface of the brain. In a chronic subdural collection, blood leaks from the veins slowly over time, or a fast hemorrhage is left to clear up on its own. A subdural hematoma is more common in older adults because of normal brain shrinkage that occurs with aging. This shrinkage stretches and weakens the bridging veins. These veins are more likely to break in older adults, even after a minor head injury. You or your family may not remember any injury that might have caused a subdural hematoma. Risks include: Long-term heavy alcohol use Long-term use of aspirin, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen, or blood thinning (anticoagulant) medicine such as warfarin Diseases that lead to reduced blood clotting Head injury Old age","In some cases, there may be no symptoms. However, depending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur: Drowsiness, confusion, or coma Decreased memory Problem speaking or swallowing Problems with balance or walking Headache Seizures or loss of consciousness Weakness or numbness of arms, legs, face Nausea and vomiting Vision problems Behavioral changes or psychosis",,Subdural hemorrhage - chronic; Subdural hematoma - chronic; Subdural hygroma
Chronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease),Chronic thyroiditis is caused by a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland. It often results in reduced thyroid function (hypothyroidism).,"Hashimoto disease is a common thyroid gland disorder. It can occur at any age, but is most often seen in middle-aged women. It is caused by a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland. The disease begins slowly. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected and for thyroid hormone levels to become lower than normal. Hashimoto disease is most common in people with a family history of thyroid disease. In rare cases, the disease may be related to other hormone problems caused by the immune system. It can occur with poor adrenal function and type 1 diabetes. In these cases, the condition is called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA II). Rarely (usually in children), Hashimoto disease occurs as part of a condition called type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I), along with: Poor function of the adrenal glands Fungal infections of the mouth and nails Underactive parathyroid gland","Symptoms of Hashimoto disease may include any of the following: Constipation Difficulty concentrating or thinking Dry skin Enlarged neck or presence of a goiter , which may be the only early symptom Fatigue Hair loss Heavy or irregular menstrual periods Intolerance to cold Mild weight gain Mood changes Small or shrunken thyroid gland (late in the disease)",,Hashimoto thyroiditis; Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis; Autoimmune thyroiditis; Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; Lymphadenoid goiter - Hashimoto; Hypothyroidism - Hashimoto; Type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome - Hashimoto; PGA II - Hashimoto; Hashimoto's disease; Hashimoto's thyroiditis
Chylomicronemia syndrome,Chylomicronemia syndrome is a disorder in which the body does not break down fats (lipids) correctly. This causes fat particles called chylomicrons to build up in the blood. The disorder is passed down through families.,"Chylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing. It can also be caused by the absence of second factor called apolipoprotein C-II (also called apoCII), which activates LpL. LpL is normally found in fat and muscle. It helps break down certain lipids. When LpL is missing or broken, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. This buildup is called chylomicronemia. Defects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well. It is more likely to occur when people who are predisposed to have high triglycerides (such as those who have familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial hypertriglyceridemia ) develop diabetes, obesity or are exposed to certain medicines.","Symptoms may start in infancy and include: Abdominal pain due to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Symptoms of nerve damage, such as loss of feeling in the feet or legs, and memory loss. Yellow deposits of fatty material in the skin called xanthomas. These growths may appear on the back, buttocks, soles of the feet, or ankles, knees and elbows.",,"Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency; Familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome, Type I hyperlipidemia"

Attacks last from 15 minutes to 3 hours, occur daily or almost daily for weeks or months. The attacks are separated by pain-free periods that last at least 1 month.","Doctors do not know exactly what causes cluster headaches. They seem to be related to the body's sudden release of histamine (chemical in the body released during an allergic response) or serotonin (chemical made by nerve cells) in the area of a nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve. A problem in a small area at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus may be involved. More men than women are affected. The headaches can occur at any age, but are most common in the 20s through middle age. They tend to run in families.

Coarctation of the aorta,"The aorta is a larger artery that carries blood from the heart to the vessels that supply the rest of the body with blood. If part of the aorta is narrowed, it is hard for blood to pass through the artery. This is called coarctation of the aorta. It is a type of birth defect.","The exact cause of coarctation of the aorta is unknown. It results from abnormalities in development of the aorta prior to birth. Aortic coarctation is more common in people with certain genetic disorders, such as Turner syndrome . Aortic coarctation is one of the more common heart conditions that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). This abnormality accounts for about 5% of all congenital heart defects. It is most often diagnosed in children or adults under age 40. People who have this problem with their aorta may also have a weak area in the wall of blood vessels in their brain. This weakness causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. This is known as a berry aneurysm. These may rupture causing a certain type of stroke (due to bleeding). Coarctation of the aorta may be seen with other congenital heart defects, such as: Bicuspid aortic valve Aortic stenosis Ventricular septal defect Patent ductus arteriosus","Symptoms depend on how much blood can flow through the artery. Other heart defects may also play a role. About half of newborns with this problem will have symptoms in the first few days of life. These can include breathing fast, problems eating, increased irritability, and increased sleepiness or becoming poorly responsive. In severe cases, the infant may develop heart failure and shock. In milder cases, symptoms may not develop until the child has reached adolescence.

Cobalt poisoning,"Cobalt is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust. It is a very small part of our environment. Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, which supports the production of red blood cells. Very small amounts are needed for animals and humans to stay healthy. Cobalt poisoning can occur when you are exposed to large amounts of it. There are three ways that cobalt can cause poisoning. You can swallow it, breathe it into your lungs, or have it come in prolonged contact with your skin.",,"Usually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms. However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at one time. The most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe it into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air. Breathing in this cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to asthma or pulmonary fibrosis, such as shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Cobalt poisoning that occurs from prolonged constant with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly. Swallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous. It may cause nausea and vomiting. However, absorbing a large amount of cobalt over longer periods of time can lead to serious health problems, such as: Cardiomyopathy (a problem where your heart becomes big and floppy and has problems pumping blood) Deafness Nerve problems Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Thickening of the blood Thyroid problems Vision problems","If you or someone you know has been exposed to cobalt, the first step is to leave the area and get fresh air.

But, cocaine's effects on other parts of the body can be very serious, or even deadly. When cocaine use is stopped or when a binge ends, a crash follows almost right away. The cocaine user has a strong craving for more cocaine during a crash. Other symptoms include fatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, and sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion or paranoia. Cocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms, such as the vomiting and shaking that accompany withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.","Symptoms of cocaine withdrawal may include: Agitation and restless behavior Depressed mood Fatigue General feeling of discomfort Increased appetite Vivid and unpleasant dreams Slowing of activity (psychomotor retardation) The craving and depression can last for months after stopping long-term heavy use. Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with suicidal thoughts in some people. During withdrawal, there can be powerful, intense cravings for cocaine.

Collapsed lung (pneumothorax),"A collapsed lung occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung between the lung and chest wall. This buildup of air puts pressure on the lung, so it cannot expand as much as it normally does when you take a breath.","Collapsed lung can be caused by an injury to the lung. Injuries can include a gunshot or knife wound to the chest, rib fracture, or certain medical procedures. In some cases, a collapsed lung is caused by air blisters of the lung (blebs) that break open, sending air into the space around the lung. This can result from air pressure changes such as when scuba diving or traveling to a high altitude. Tall, thin people and smokers are more at risk for a collapsed lung. Lung diseases can also increase the chance of getting a collapsed lung.

Color blindness,Color blindness is the inability to see some colors in the usual way.,"Color blindness occurs when there is a problem with the pigments in certain nerve cells of the eye that sense color. These cells are called cones. They are found in the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina . If just one pigment is missing, you may have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. If a different pigment is missing, you may have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness often have problems seeing reds and greens, too. The most severe form of color blindness is achromatopsia. This is a rare condition in which a person cannot see any color, only shades of gray. Most color blindness is due to a genetic problem . About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness. Very few women are color blind. The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can also cause color blindness. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions.","Symptoms vary from person to person, but may include: Trouble seeing colors and the brightness of colors in the usual way Inability to tell the difference between shades of the same or similar colors Often, symptoms are so mild that people may not know they are color blind.

Colorectal cancer,Colorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). It is also sometimes simply called colon cancer.,Nearly all colorectal cancers begin as noncancerous (benign) lumps (polyps) in the lining of the colon and rectum. These can slowly develop into cancer.

Colorectal polyps,A colorectal polyp is a growth on the lining of the colon or rectum.,"Polyps of the colon and rectum are most often benign . This means they are not a cancer. You may have one or many polyps. They become more common with age. There are many types of polyps. Adenomatous polyps are a common type. They are gland-like growths that develop on the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine. They are also called adenomas and are most often one of the following: Tubular polyp, which protrudes out in the lumen (open space) of the colon Villous adenoma, which is sometimes flat and spreading, and is more likely to become a cancer When adenomas become cancerous, they are known as adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that originate in glandular tissue cells. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer. Other types of polyps are: Hyperplastic polyps, which rarely, if ever, develop into cancer Serrated polyps, which are less common, but may develop into cancer over time Polyps that are 1 centimeter (cm) or larger have a higher cancer risk than polyps smaller than 1 cm. Risk factors include: Age Family history of colon cancer or polyps A type of polyp called villous adenoma A small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) Gardner syndrome (a type of FAP) Juvenile polyposis, a disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years old Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestine Peutz-Jeghers syndrome , a disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benign","Polyps usually do not have symptoms.

Common cold,"The common cold most often causes a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. You may also have a sore throat, cough, headache, or other symptoms.","It is called the common cold for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness. Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children. Children can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares. Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons. A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can catch a cold if: A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob People are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is most often not contagious after the first week.","Cold symptoms usually start about 2 or 3 days after you came in contact with the virus, although it could take up to a week. Symptoms mostly affect the nose. The most common cold symptoms are: Nasal congestion Runny nose Scratchy throat Sneezing Adults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever.

Common peroneal nerve dysfunction,Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is due to damage to the peroneal nerve leading to loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg. This condition is also called common fibular nerve dysfunction.,"The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot and toes. Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord). This condition can affect people of any age. Common peroneal nerve is a type of mononeuropathy . Mononeuropathy is nerve damage to a single nerve. Certain body-wide conditions can also cause single nerve injuries. Damage to the nerve disrupts the myelin sheath that covers the axon (branch of the nerve cell). The axon can also be injured, which is a more severe injury that causes similar symptoms. Common causes of damage to the common peroneal nerve include the following: Trauma or injury to the knee Fracture of the fibula (a bone of the lower leg) Use of a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg Crossing the legs regularly Regularly wearing high boots Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma Injury during knee surgery or from being placed in an awkward position during anesthesia Common peroneal nerve injury is often seen in people: Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa ) Who have certain autoimmune conditions, such as polyarteritis nodosa Who have nerve damage from other medical problems, such as diabetes, excess alcohol use, or inherited nerve disorders","When the nerve is injured and results in dysfunction, symptoms may include: Decreased sensation , numbness, or tingling in the top of the foot or the outer part of the upper or lower leg Foot that drops (unable to hold the foot up) ""Slapping"" gait (walking pattern in which each step makes a slapping noise) Toes drag while walking Walking problems Weakness of the ankles or feet Loss of muscle mass because the nerves aren't stimulating the muscles",,Common fibular nerve dysfunction; Neuropathy - common peroneal nerve; Peroneal nerve injury; Peroneal nerve palsy; Fibular neuropathy
Community-acquired pneumonia in adults,Pneumonia is a breathing (respiratory) condition in which there is an infection of the lung.,"Pneumonia is a common illness that affects millions of people each year in the United States. Germs called bacteria, viruses, and fungi may cause pneumonia. In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia. Ways you can get pneumonia include: Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs. You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth into your lungs ( aspiration pneumonia ). Pneumonia can be caused by many types of germs. The most common type of bacteria is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia , often called walking pneumonia, is caused by other bacteria. A fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause pneumonia in people whose immune system is not working well, especially people with advanced HIV infection. Viruses , such as the flu virus, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19 ), are also common causes of pneumonia. Risk factors that increase your chance of getting pneumonia include: Chronic lung disease ( COPD , bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis ) Cigarette smoking Dementia , stroke , brain injury, cerebral palsy , or other brain disorders Immune system problem (during cancer treatment, or due to HIV/AIDS , organ transplant, or other diseases) Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease , liver cirrhosis , or diabetes Recent surgery or trauma Surgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat, or neck","The most common symptoms of pneumonia are: Cough (with some pneumonias you may cough up greenish or yellow mucus, or even bloody mucus) Fever , which may be mild or high Shaking chills Shortness of breath (may only occur when you climb stairs or exert yourself) Other symptoms include: Confusion , especially in older people Excess sweating and clammy skin Headache Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue Malaise (not feeling well) Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough White nail syndrome, or leukonychia",,Bronchopneumonia; Community-acquired pneumonia; CAP
Compartment syndrome,Acute compartment syndrome is a serious condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment. It can lead to muscle and nerve damage and problems with blood flow.,"Thick layers of tissue, called fascia, separate groups of muscles in the arms and legs from each other. Inside each layer of fascia is a confined space, called a compartment. The compartment includes the muscle tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. Fascia surrounds these structures, similar to the way in which insulation covers wires. Fascia do not expand. Any swelling in a compartment will lead to increased pressure in that area. This raised pressure, presses the muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. If this pressure is high enough, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked. This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves. If the pressure lasts long enough, the muscles may die and the arm or leg will no longer work. Surgery or even amputation may be done to correct the problem. Acute compartment syndrome may be caused by: Trauma, such as a crush injury or surgery Broken bone Very bruised muscle Severe sprain A cast or bandage that is too tight Loss of blood supply due to the use of a tourniquet or positioning during surgery Exertional compartment syndrome can be caused by repetitive activities, such as running. The pressure in a compartment only increases during that activity and goes down after the activity is stopped. This condition is usually less limiting and does not lead to loss of function or limb. However, the pain can limit activity and endurance. There is usually no permanent injury to the limb. Compartment syndrome is most common in the lower leg and forearm. It can also occur in the hand, foot, thigh, buttocks, and upper arm.","Symptoms of compartment syndrome are not easy to detect. With an acute injury, the symptoms can become severe within a few hours. Symptoms may include: Pain that is much higher than expected with the injury Severe pain that doesn't go away after taking pain medicine or raising the affected area Decreased sensation, numbness, tingling, weakness of the affected area Paleness of skin Swelling or inability to move the affected part",,Fracture - compartment syndrome; Surgery - compartment syndrome; Trauma - compartment syndrome; Muscle bruise - compartment syndrome; Fasciotomy - compartment syndrome

Complex regional pain syndrome,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a long-term (chronic) pain condition that can affect any area of the body, but often affects an arm or a leg.","Health care providers are not sure what causes CRPS. In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area. CRPS has two forms: CRPS 1 is a chronic nerve disorder that occurs most often in the arms or legs after a minor injury. CRPS 2 is caused by an injury to a nerve. CRPS is thought to result from damage to the nervous system. This includes the nerves that control the blood vessels and sweat glands. The damaged nerves are no longer able to properly control blood flow, feeling (sensation), and temperature to the affected area. This leads to problems in the: Blood vessels Bones Muscles Nerves Skin Possible causes of CRPS: Injury directly to a nerve Injury or infection in an arm or leg In rare cases, sudden illnesses such as a heart attack or stroke can cause CRPS. The condition can sometimes appear without obvious injury to the affected limb. This condition is more common in people ages 40 to 60, but younger people can develop it, too.","The key symptom is pain that: Is intense and often burning and is much stronger than would be expected for the type of injury that occurred. Gets worse, rather than better over time. Begins at the point of injury, but may spread to the whole limb, or to the arm or leg on the opposite side of the body. In most cases, CRPS has three stages. But, CRPS does not always follow this pattern. Some people develop severe symptoms right away. Others stay in the first stage. Stage 1 (lasts 1 to 3 months): Changes in skin temperature, switching between warm or cold Faster growth of nails and hair Muscle spasms and joint pain Severe burning, aching pain that worsens with the slightest touch or breeze Skin that slowly becomes blotchy, purple, pale, or red; thin and shiny; swollen; more sweaty Stage 2 (lasts 3 to 6 months): Continued changes in the skin Nails that are cracked and break more easily Pain that is becoming worse Slower hair growth Stiff joints and weak muscles Stage 3 (irreversible changes can be seen) Limited movement in limb because of tightened muscles and tendons (contracture) Muscle wasting Pain in the entire limb If pain and other symptoms are severe or long-lasting, many people may experience depression or anxiety.",,CRPS; RSDS; Causalgia - RSD; Shoulder-hand syndrome; Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome; Sudeck atrophy; Pain - CRPS

Compression fractures of the back,Compression fractures of the back are broken vertebrae. Vertebrae are the bones of the spine.,"Osteoporosis is the most common cause of this type of fracture. Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile. In most cases, bone loses calcium and other minerals with age. Other causes of compression fractures may include: Trauma to the back Tumors that spread to the bone from elsewhere Tumors that start in the spine, such as multiple myeloma Having many fractures of the vertebrae can lead to kyphosis . This is a hump-like curvature of the spine.","Compression fractures can occur suddenly. This can cause severe back pain. The pain is most commonly felt in the middle or lower spine. It can also be felt on the sides or in the front of the spine. The pain is often sharp and ""knife-like."" Pain can be disabling, and take weeks to months to go away. Compression fractures due to osteoporosis may cause no symptoms at first. Often, they are discovered when x-rays of the spine are done for other reasons. Over time, the following symptoms may occur: Back pain that starts slowly, and gets worse with walking, but is not felt when resting Loss of height, as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) over time Stooped-over posture, or kyphosis, also called a dowager's hump Pressure on the spinal cord from hunched over posture can, in rare cases, cause: Numbness Tingling Weakness Difficulty walking Loss of control of the bowel or bladder",,Vertebral compression fractures; Osteoporosis - compression fracture
Compulsive gambling,"Compulsive gambling is being unable to resist impulses to gamble. This can lead to severe money problems, job loss, crime or fraud, and damage to family relationships.","Compulsive gambling most often begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women. People with compulsive gambling have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. The brain is reacting to this impulse in the same manner it reacts to a person addicted to alcohol or illegal drugs. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), compulsive gambling is likely a different condition. In people who develop compulsive gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.","People with compulsive gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem. The American Psychiatric Association defines gambling disorder as having 4 or more of the following symptoms: Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back or quit gambling. Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or anxiety. Gambling larger amounts of money to try to make back past losses. Losing a job, relationship, education, or career opportunity due to gambling. Lying about the amount of time or money spent on gambling.

Confusion,"Confusion is the inability to think as clearly or quickly as you normally do. You may feel disoriented and have difficulty paying attention, remembering, and making decisions.","Confusion may be caused by different health problems, such as: Alcohol or drug intoxication Brain tumor Head trauma or head injury ( concussion ) Fever Fluid and electrolyte imbalance Illness in an older person, such as loss of brain function ( dementia ) Illness in a person with existing neurological disease, such as a stroke Infections Lack of sleep (sleep deprivation) Low blood sugar Low levels of oxygen (for example, from chronic lung disorders) Medicines Nutritional deficiencies, especially niacin , thiamine , or vitamin B12 Seizures Sudden drop in body temperature ( hypothermia )",,"A good way to find out if someone is confused is to ask the person his or her name, age, and the date. If they are unsure or answer incorrectly, they are confused. If the person does not usually have confusion, contact a health care provider. A confused person should not be left alone. For safety, the person may need someone nearby to calm them and protect them from injury. Rarely, physical restraints may be ordered by a health care professional. To help a confused person: Always introduce yourself, no matter how well the person once knew you. Often remind the person of his or her location. Place a calendar and clock near the person. Talk about current events and plans for the day. Try to keep the surroundings calm, quiet, and peaceful. For sudden confusion due to low blood sugar (for example, from diabetes medicine), the person should drink a sweet drink or eat a sweet snack. If the confusion lasts longer than 10 minutes, contact the provider.",Disorientation; Thinking - unclear; Thoughts - cloudy; Altered mental status - confusion
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the name given to a group of inherited disorders of the adrenal gland. Inherited means the traits are passed down from parent to child.,"Your adrenal glands are 2 walnut-sized organs that sit one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make the following hormones that are essential for life. Cortisol regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, and energy levels. It also helps your body respond to illness and stress. Aldosterone helps manage sodium and potassium levels in your blood to help regulate blood pressure. Androgens are male sex hormones, such as testosterone. These hormones play a role in growth and development in both males and females. Most people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) lack an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal glands need this enzyme to make enough cortisol and aldosterone. Because of low cortisol levels, the body stimulates the adrenal gland, which then produces more androgen. This results in an imbalance of these hormones. There are two main types of CAH that make up most of all cases: classic CAH and nonclassic CAH. Classic CAH is rarer and more serious. It is often found at birth or early infancy. The body makes too little aldosterone and cortisol and too much androgen. There are two subtypes of classic CAH: Salt-wasting CAH. This is the most serious form, and it can cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes too little aldosterone to regulate the sodium levels in the blood. This results in loss of sodium through the urine. It can be life-threatening without treatment. Simple-virilizing CAH. This more moderate form of CAH does not cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes enough aldosterone to regulate sodium levels, but it still produces too little cortisol and too much androgen. Nonclassic CAH is the mildest and most common form. The body produces enough aldosterone and cortisol, but too much androgen. It often is not diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood. The person may not have any or only mild symptoms.","Symptoms will vary, depending on the type of CAH someone has and their age when the disorder is diagnosed. Females with classic CAH often have ambiguous genitalia at birth and may be diagnosed before symptoms appear. Males have typical male genitalia at birth, even if they have a more severe form. In children classic, salt-wasting CAH, several adrenal symptoms often develop within 2 or 3 weeks after birth. They may include: Poor feeding or vomiting Diarrhea Dehydration Electrolyte changes (abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in the blood) Abnormal heart rhythm Low blood glucose Too much acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis) Weight loss Shock Females with nonclassic CAH will usually have normal female reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes). They may also have the following changes: Abnormal menstrual periods or failure to menstruate Early appearance of pubic or armpit hair Severe acne Excessive hair growth or facial hair Some enlargement of the clitoris Males with nonclassic CAH often appear normal at birth. However, they may appear to enter puberty early. Symptoms may include: Deepening voice Severe acne Early appearance of pubic or armpit hair Enlarged penis but normal testes Well-developed muscles Both males and females will grow rapidly during childhood, but be much shorter than normal as adults.",,Adrenogenital syndrome; 21-hydroxylase deficiency; CAH
Congenital antithrombin III deficiency,Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is a genetic disorder that causes the blood to clot more than normal.,Antithrombin III is a protein in the blood that blocks abnormal blood clots from forming. It helps the body keep a healthy balance between bleeding and clotting. Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease. It occurs when a person receives one abnormal copy of the antithrombin III gene from a parent with the disease. The abnormal gene leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein. This low level of antithrombin III can cause abnormal blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs. People with this condition will often have blood clots at a young age. They are also likely to have family members who have had a blood clotting problem.,"People will usually have symptoms of a blood clot. Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain. When a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body, it is called a thromboembolism. Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to. A common place is the lung, where the clot can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a stroke .",,Deficiency - antithrombin III - congenital; Antithrombin III deficiency - congenital
Congenital cataract,A congenital cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye that is present at birth. The lens of the eye is normally clear. It focuses light that comes into the eye onto the retina.,"Unlike most cataracts, which occur with aging, congenital cataracts are present at birth. Congenital cataracts are rare. In most people, no cause can be found. Congenital cataracts often occur as part of the following birth defects: Chondrodysplasia syndrome Congenital rubella Conradi-Hünermann syndrome Down syndrome (trisomy 21) Ectodermal dysplasia syndrome Familial congenital cataracts Galactosemia Hallermann-Streiff syndrome Lowe syndrome Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome Pierre-Robin syndrome Trisomy 13","Congenital cataracts most often look different than other forms of cataract. Symptoms may include: An infant does not seem to be visually aware of the world around them (if cataracts are in both eyes) Gray or white cloudiness of the pupil (which is normally black) The ""red eye"" glow (red reflex) of the pupil is missing in photos, or is different between the 2 eyes Unusual rapid eye movements ( nystagmus )",,Cataract - congenital
Congenital cytomegalovirus,Congenital cytomegalovirus is a condition that can occur when an infant is infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) before birth. Congenital means the condition is present at birth.,"Congenital CMV occurs when an infected mother passes CMV to the fetus through the placenta. The mother may not have symptoms, so she may be unaware that she has CMV.",Most children with congenital CMV do not have symptoms.

Congenital fibrinogen deficiency,"Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is a very rare, inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It affects a protein called fibrinogen. This protein is needed for the blood to clot.","This disease is due to a deficiency of the amount or function of fibrinogen. How fibrinogen is affected depends on how the genes that determine how it is formed are inherited: When the abnormal gene is passed down from both parents, a person will have a complete lack of fibrinogen (afibrinogenemia). When the abnormal gene is passed down from one parent, a person will have either a reduced level of fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) or a problem with the function of fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia). Sometimes, these two fibrinogen problems can occur in the same person.",People with a complete lack of fibrinogen may have any of the following bleeding symptoms: Bruising easily Bleeding from the umbilical cord just after birth Bleeding in the mucous membranes Bleeding in the brain (very rare) Bleeding in the joints Heavy bleeding after injury or surgery Nosebleeds that do not stop easily People with a reduced level of fibrinogen bleed less often and the bleeding is not as severe when compared to people with no fibrinogen at all.

Congenital heart disease,Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth.,"CHD can describe a number of different problems affecting the heart. It is the most common type of birth defect. CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects. CHD is often divided into two types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common CHDs: Cyanotic: Ebstein anomaly Hypoplastic left heart Pulmonary atresia Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous return Transposition of the great vessels Tricuspid atresia Truncus arteriosus Non-cyanotic: Aortic stenosis Bicuspid aortic valve Atrial septal defect (ASD) Atrioventricular canal ( endocardial cushion defect ) Coarctation of the aorta Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Pulmonic stenosis Ventricular septal defect (VSD) These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families. Examples include: DiGeorge syndrome Down syndrome Marfan syndrome Noonan syndrome Edwards syndrome Trisomy 13 Turner syndrome Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. CHDs continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella ) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems. Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to an increased rate of congenital heart defects.","Symptoms depend on the condition. Although CHD is present at birth, the symptoms may not appear right away. Defects such as coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for years. Other problems, such as a small VSD , ASD, or PDA may never cause any problems.",,
Congenital nephrotic syndrome,Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a disorder that is passed down through families in which a baby develops protein in the urine and swelling of the body.,"Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that each parent must pass on a copy of the defective gene in order for the child to have the disease. Although congenital means present from birth, with congenital nephrotic syndrome, symptoms of the disease occur in the first 3 months of life. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a very rare form of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by a set of abnormal findings that include: Protein in the urine Low blood protein levels in the blood High cholesterol levels High triglyceride levels Swelling Children with this disorder have an abnormal form of a protein called nephrin. The kidney's filters (glomeruli) need this protein to function normally.",Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include: Cough Decreased urine output Foamy appearance of urine Low birth weight Poor appetite Swelling (total body),,Nephrotic syndrome - congenital
Congenital platelet function defects,"Congenital platelet function defects are conditions that prevent clotting elements in the blood, called platelets, from working as they should. Platelets help the blood clot. Congenital means present from birth.","Congenital platelet function defects are bleeding disorders that cause reduced platelet function. Most of the time, people with these disorders have a family history of a bleeding disorder, such as: Bernard-Soulier syndrome occurs when platelets lack a substance that sticks to the walls of blood vessels. Platelets are typically large and reduced in number. This disorder may cause severe bleeding. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a condition caused by the lack of a protein needed for platelets to clump together. Platelets are typically of normal size and number. This disorder may also cause severe bleeding. Platelet storage pool disorder (also called platelet secretion disorder) occurs when substances called granules inside platelets aren't stored or released properly. Granules help platelets function properly. This disorder causes easy bruising or bleeding.",Symptoms may include any of the following: Excessive bleeding during and after surgery Bleeding gums Easy bruising or pinpoint red spots on the skin Heavy menstrual periods Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding with small injuries,,Platelet storage pool disorder; Glanzmann's thrombasthenia; Bernard-Soulier syndrome; Platelet function defects - congenital
Congenital protein C or S deficiency,Congenital protein C or S deficiency is a lack of proteins C or S in the fluid part of the blood. The proteins are natural substances that help prevent blood clots.,"Congenital protein C or S deficiency is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. Congenital means it is present at birth. The disorder causes abnormal blood clotting. One in 300 people has one normal gene and one faulty gene for protein C deficiency. Protein S deficiency is much less common and occurs in about 1 in 20,000 people.","If you have this condition, you are more likely to develop blood clots, especially at a younger age. The symptoms are the same as for deep vein thrombosis , and include: Pain or tenderness in the affected area Redness or swelling in the affected area",,Protein S deficiency; Protein C deficiency
Congenital rubella,Congenital rubella is a condition that occurs in an infant whose mother is infected with the virus that causes German measles. Congenital means the condition is present at birth.,"Congenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, if the mother has a rubella infection, it is less likely to harm the developing baby. The number of babies born with this condition is much smaller since the rubella vaccine was developed. Pregnant women and their unborn babies are at risk if: They are not vaccinated for rubella They have not had the disease in the past",Symptoms in the infant may include: Cloudy corneas or white appearance of pupil Deafness Developmental delay Excessive sleepiness Irritability Low birth weight Below average mental functioning (intellectual disability) Seizures Small head size Skin rash at birth,,
Congenital syphilis,"Congenital syphilis is a severe, disabling, and often life-threatening infection seen in infants whose mothers were infected with syphilis and not fully treated. The infection can pass through the placenta to the unborn infant during pregnancy.","Congenital syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum , which can be passed from mother to child during fetal development or at birth. Up to half of all babies infected with syphilis in the womb die shortly before or after birth. Despite the fact that this disease can be cured with antibiotics if caught early, rising rates of syphilis among pregnant women in the United States have increased the number of infants born with congenital syphilis since 2013.","Most babies who are infected before birth appear normal. Over time, symptoms may develop. In babies younger than 2 years old, symptoms may include: Enlarged liver and/or spleen (mass in belly) Failure to gain weight or failure to thrive (including prior to birth, with low birthweight) Fever Irritability Irritation and cracking of skin around the mouth, genitals, and anus Rash starting as small blisters, especially on the palms and soles, and later changing to copper-colored, flat or bumpy rash Skeletal (bone) abnormalities Not able to move a painful arm or leg Watery fluid from the nose Symptoms in older infants and young children may include: Abnormal notched and peg-shaped teeth, called Hutchinson teeth Bone pain Blindness Clouding of the cornea (the covering of the eyeball) Decreased hearing or deafness Deformity of the nose with flattened nasal bridge ( saddle nose ) Gray, mucus-like patches around the anus and vagina Joint swelling Saber shins (bone problem of the lower leg) Scarring of the skin around the mouth, genitals, and anus",,Fetal syphilis
Congenital toxoplasmosis,Congenital toxoplasmosis is a group of symptoms that occur when an unborn baby (fetus) is infected with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.,"Toxoplasmosis infection can be passed to a developing baby if the mother becomes infected while pregnant. The infection spreads to the developing baby across the placenta. Most of the time, the infection is mild in the mother. The woman may not be aware she has the parasite. However, infection of the developing baby can cause serious problems. Problems are worse if the infection occurs in early pregnancy.","Up to half babies who become infected with toxoplasmosis during the pregnancy are born early (prematurely). The infection can damage the baby's eyes, nervous system, skin, and ears. Often, there are signs of infection at birth. However, babies with mild infections may not have symptoms for months or years after birth. If not treated, most children with this infection develop problems in their teens. Eye problems are common. Symptoms may include: Enlarged liver and spleen Vomiting Eye damage from inflammation of the retina or other parts of the eye Feeding problems Hearing loss Jaundice (yellow skin) Low birth weight (intrauterine growth restriction) Skin rash (tiny red spots or bruising) at birth Vision problems Brain and nervous system damage ranges from very mild to severe, and may include: Seizures Intellectual disability",,
Conjunctiva,"The conjunctiva is a thin, clear membrane that covers the inner surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eyeball (the sclera). It contains many tiny blood vessels.",,,,
Conjunctivitis or pink eye,The conjunctiva is a clear layer of tissue lining the eyelids and covering the white of the eye. Conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes swollen or inflamed.,"Tears most often protect the eyes by washing away germs and irritants. Tears contain proteins and antibodies that kill germs. If your eyes are dry, germs and irritants are more likely to cause problems. Conjunctivitis is most often caused by germs such as viruses and bacteria. ""Pink eye"" most often refers to a highly contagious viral infection that spreads easily among children. Conjunctivitis can be found in people with COVID-19 before they have other typical symptoms. In newborns, an eye infection may be caused by bacteria in the birth canal. This must be treated at once to preserve eyesight. Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances. A type of long-term allergic conjunctivitis may occur in people who have chronic allergies or asthma. This condition is called vernal conjunctivitis . It most commonly occurs in young men and boys in the spring and summer months. A similar condition can occur in long-time contact lens wearers. It may make it difficult to continue to wear contact lenses. Anything which irritates the eye may also cause conjunctivitis. These include: Chemicals. Smoke. Dust. Over-use of contact lenses (often extended-wear lenses) can lead to conjunctivitis.",Symptoms include: Blurred vision Crusts that form on the eyelid overnight (most often caused by bacteria) Eye pain Gritty feeling in the eyes Increased tearing Itching of the eye Redness in the eyes Sensitivity to light,,"Inflammation - conjunctiva; Pink eye; Chemical conjunctivitis, Pinkeye; Pink-eye; Allergic conjunctivitis"

Constipation in infants and children,Constipation in infants and children means they have hard stools or have problems passing stools. A child may have pain while passing stools or may be unable to have a bowel movement after straining or pushing.,"Constipation occurs when the stool remains in the colon for too long. Too much water gets absorbed by the colon, leaving hard, dry stools. Constipation may be caused by: Ignoring the urge to use the toilet Not eating enough fiber Not drinking enough fluids Switching to solid foods or from breast milk to formula (infants) Changes in situation, such as travel, starting school, or stressful events Medical causes of constipation may include: Diseases of the bowel, such as those that affect the bowel muscles or nerves Other medical conditions that affect the bowel Use of certain medicines Children may ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because: They are not ready for toilet training They are learning to control their bowel movements They have had previous painful bowel movements and want to avoid them They don't want to use a school or public toilet",,"Lifestyle changes can help your child avoid constipation. These changes can also be used to treat it. For infants: Give your baby extra water or juice during the day in between feedings. Juice can help bring water to the colon. Over 2 months old: Try 2 to 4 ounces (59 to 118 mL) of fruit juice (grape, pear, apple, cherry, or prune) twice a day. Over 4 months old: If the baby has started to eat solid foods, try baby foods with high-fiber content such as peas, beans, apricots, prunes, peaches, pears, plums, and spinach twice a day. For children: Drink plenty of fluids each day. Your child's health care provider can tell you how much. Eat more fruits and vegetables and foods high in fiber, such as whole grains. Avoid certain foods such as cheese, fast food, prepared and processed foods, meat, and ice cream. Stop toilet training if your child becomes constipated. Resume after your child is no longer constipated. Teach older children to use the toilet right after eating a meal. Stool softeners (such as those containing docusate sodium) may help for older children. Bulk laxatives such as psyllium may help add fluid and bulk to the stool. Suppositories or gentle laxatives may help your child have regular bowel movements. Electrolyte solutions like Miralax can also be effective. Some children may need enemas or prescription laxatives. These methods should be used only if fiber, fluids, and stool softeners do not provide enough relief. Do not give laxatives or enemas to children without first asking your child's provider.",Irregularity of bowels; Lack of regular bowel movements

Contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis is a condition in which the skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed after direct contact with a substance.","There are 2 types of contact dermatitis. Irritant dermatitis: This is the most common type. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to irritating substances or friction. Irritating substances may include acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents , fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. Very irritating chemicals may cause a reaction after just a short period of contact. Milder chemicals can also cause a reaction after repeated contact. People who have atopic dermatitis are at increased risk of developing irritant contact dermatitis. Common materials that may irritate your skin include: Cement Hair dyes Long-term exposure to wet diapers Pesticides or weed killers Rubber gloves Shampoos Allergic contact dermatitis: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction. Common allergens include: Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees. Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin. Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks). Fabrics and clothing, including both materials and dyes. Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers. Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions. Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts). Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants. Rubber or latex gloves or shoes. Preservatives commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter topical medicines. Formaldehyde, which is used in a broad number of manufactured items. You will not have an allergic reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. It is possible to tolerate the substance for years or even decades before developing allergy. Once you develop an allergy you will be allergic for life. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure. The rash may persist for weeks after the exposure stops. Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include: Shaving lotions Sunscreens Sulfa ointments Some perfumes Coal tar products Oil from the skin of a lime A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed, perfumes, vapor from nail lacquer, or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.","Symptoms vary, depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time. Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months or years of exposure. Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it. Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe. You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure. The rash may: Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters Feel warm and tender Ooze, drain, or crust Become scaly, raw, or thickened Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching.

Cor pulmonale,Cor pulmonale is a condition that causes the right side of the heart to fail. Long-term high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lung and right ventricle of the heart can lead to cor pulmonale.,"High blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs is called pulmonary hypertension . It is the most common cause of cor pulmonale. In people who have pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs can lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. If this high pressure continues, it puts a strain on the right side of the heart. That strain can cause cor pulmonale. Lung conditions that cause a low blood oxygen level in the blood over a long time can also lead to cor pulmonale. Some of these are: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic blood clots in the lungs Cystic fibrosis (CF) Severe bronchiectasis Scarring of the lung tissue ( interstitial lung disease ) Severe curving of the upper part of the spine ( kyphoscoliosis ) Obstructive sleep apnea , which causes stops in breathing during sleep Idiopathic (no specific cause) tightening (constriction) of the blood vessels of the lungs, also called primary pulmonary hypertension Severe left-sided heart failure","Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom of cor pulmonale. You may also have a fast heartbeat and feel like your heart is pounding. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while you are at rest.

Corneal ulcers and infections,"The cornea is the clear tissue at the front of the eye. A corneal ulcer is an open sore in the outer layer of the cornea. It is often caused by infection. At first, a corneal ulcer may seem like conjunctivitis, or pink eye.","Corneal ulcers are most commonly caused by an infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi, or a parasite. Acanthamoeba keratitis occurs in contact lens users. It is more likely to happen in people who make their own homemade cleaning solutions. Fungal keratitis can occur after a corneal injury involving plant material. It may also occur in people with a suppressed immune system. Herpes simplex virus keratitis is a serious viral infection. It may cause repeated attacks that are triggered by stress, exposure to sunlight, or any condition that lowers the immune response. Corneal ulcers or infections may also be caused by: Eyelids that do not close all the way, such as with Bell palsy Foreign bodies in the eye Scratches (abrasions) on the eye surface Severely dry eyes Severe allergic eye disease Various inflammatory disorders Wearing contact lenses, especially soft contacts that are left in overnight, may cause a corneal ulcer. Watch this video about: Corneal injury",Symptoms of infections or ulcers of the cornea include: Blurry or hazy vision Eye that appears red or bloodshot Itching and discharge Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Very painful and watery eyes White patch on the cornea,,Bacterial keratitis; Fungal keratitis; Acanthamoeba keratitis; Herpes simplex keratitis
Corns and calluses,Corns and calluses are thick layers of skin. They are caused by repeated pressure or friction at the spot where the corn or callus develops.,"Corns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on skin. A corn is thickened skin on the top or side of a toe. Most of the time it is caused by bad-fitting shoes. A callus is thickened skin on your hands or the soles of your feet. The thickening of the skin is a protective reaction. For example, farmers and rowers get calluses on their hands that prevent blisters from forming. People with bunions often develop a callus over the bunion because it rubs against the shoe. Corns and calluses may be painful but are not serious problems for most people.","Symptoms may include: Skin is thick and hardened. Skin may be flaky and dry. Hardened, thick skin areas are found on hands, feet, or other areas that may be rubbed or pressed. The affected areas can be painful and may bleed.",,Calluses and corns

Coronary artery fistula,Coronary artery fistula is an abnormal connection between one of the coronary arteries and a heart chamber or another blood vessel. The coronary arteries are blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood to the heart.,"A coronary artery fistula is often congenital, meaning that it is present at birth. It generally occurs when one of the coronary arteries fails to form properly. This most often takes place when the baby is developing in the womb. The coronary artery abnormally attaches to one of the chambers of the heart (the atrium or ventricle) or another blood vessel (for example, the pulmonary artery). A coronary artery fistula can also develop after birth. It may be caused by: An infection that weakens the wall of the coronary artery and the heart Certain types of heart surgery Injury to the heart from an accident or surgery Coronary artery fistula is a rare condition. Infants who are born with it sometimes also have other heart defects. These may include: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum","Infants with this condition often do not have any symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they can include: Heart murmur Chest discomfort or pain Easy fatigue Failure to thrive Fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) Shortness of breath (dyspnea)",,Congenital heart defect - coronary artery fistula; Birth defect heart - coronary artery fistula
Coronary artery spasm,"The coronary arteries supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Coronary artery spasm is a brief, sudden narrowing of one of these arteries.","The spasm often occurs in coronary arteries that have not become hardened due to plaque buildup. However, it also can occur in arteries with plaque buildup. These spasms are due to a squeezing of muscles in the artery wall. They most often occur in just one area of the artery. The coronary artery may appear normal during testing, but it does not function normally at other times. About 2% of people with angina (chest pain and pressure) have coronary artery spasm. Coronary artery spasm occurs most commonly in people who smoke or who have high cholesterol or high blood pressure . It may occur without cause, or it may be triggered by: Alcohol withdrawal Emotional stress Exposure to cold Medicines that cause narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction) Stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine Cocaine use and cigarette smoking can cause severe spasms of the arteries. This causes the heart to work harder. In many people, coronary artery spasm may occur without any other heart risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol).","Spasm may be ""silent"" (without symptoms) or it may result in chest pain or angina. If the spasm lasts long enough, it may even cause a heart attack. The main symptom is a type of chest pain called angina. Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the: Arm (most often the left) Back Jaw Neck Shoulder Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion. It is most often severe. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arm. The pain of coronary artery spasm: Often occurs at rest May occur at the same time each day, usually between midnight and 8:00 a.m. Lasts from 5 to 30 minutes The person may lose consciousness. Chest pain and shortness of breath due to coronary artery spasm are often not caused by exercise, unlike angina that is caused by hardening of the coronary arteries.",,Variant angina; Angina - variant; Prinzmetal angina; Vasospastic angina; Chest pain - Prinzmetal
Coronary heart disease,Coronary heart disease is a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is also called coronary artery disease.,"CHD is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women. CHD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries to your heart. This may also be called hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis. Fatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart. This buildup causes the arteries to get narrow. As a result, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop. A risk factor for heart disease is something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.","In some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is more often true in the early stages of CHD. Chest pain or discomfort ( angina ) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person. It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your breast bone (sternum). You may also feel it in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back. The pain most often occurs with activity or emotion. It goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion), or even feeling lightheaded or passing out with exertion. Some people have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: Fatigue Shortness of breath General weakness",,"Heart disease, Coronary heart disease, Coronary artery disease; Arteriosclerotic heart disease; CHD; CAD"
Coronavirus,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses. Infection with these viruses generally causes mild to moderate respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold. Some coronaviruses cause severe illness that can lead to pneumonia, and even death.","There are many different coronaviruses. They affect both humans and animals. Common human coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold . Some animal coronaviruses evolve (mutate) and are passed from animals to humans. They may then spread through person-to-person contact. The coronaviruses that spread from animals to humans can sometimes cause more severe illness: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious form of pneumonia . It is caused by the SARS-CoV coronavirus. No cases in humans have been reported since 2004. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory illness. MERS is caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 30% of people who have gotten this illness have died. Some people only have mild symptoms. MERS continues to cause illness in humans, mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. COVID-19 can be a respiratory illness that causes cold or flu-like symptoms, but it can also affect other parts of your body. It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). COVID-19 can be a mild to serious illness and even fatal. COVID-19 is a serious public health threat globally and in the United States. Many coronaviruses originate in bats, which can then infect other animals. SARS-CoV spreads from civet cats, while MERS-CoV spreads from camels. The latest virus, SARS-CoV-2, is also suspected to have originated from animals. It is from the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV, which is why they have similar names. There are many other coronaviruses circulating in animals, but they haven't spread to humans. Once a person has been infected by a coronavirus, the infection can spread to a healthy person (person-to-person transmission). You can catch coronavirus infection when: An infected person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you and releases the virus into the air (droplet infection) You touch, hug, shake hands with, or kiss an infected person","Human coronaviruses that cause the common cold spread from person-to-person. Symptoms develop in 2 to 14 days. These include: Runny nose Sore throat Sneezing Nasal congestion Fever, often with chills Headache Body aches Cough Exposure to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe symptoms. These include: Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Diarrhea Blood in cough Death Severe coronavirus infection may cause: Croup Pneumonia Bronchiolitis Bronchitis Symptoms may be severe in certain people: Children Older adults People with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, or HIV infection People with respiratory illnesses such as asthma or COPD",,Coronavirus - SARS; Coronavirus - 2019-nCoV; Coronavirus - COVID-19; Coronavirus - Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Coronavirus - Middle East respiratory syndrome; Coronavirus - MERS
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that causes fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, but many other symptoms can occur. COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious virus. Most people get mild to moderate illness. Older adults and people with certain health conditions are at high risk for severe illness and death. More than one million people in the United States have died from COVID-19.","COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can affect people and animals. They can cause mild to moderate respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold . Some coronaviruses can cause severe illness that can lead to pneumonia and even death. COVID-19 most readily spreads to people within close contact (about 6 feet or 2 meters). When someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, droplets and very small particles spray into the air. You can catch the illness if you breathe in these droplets or particles or they land on your eyes, nose, or mouth. In some instances, COVID-19 may spread through the air and infect people who are more than 6 feet away. Small droplets and particles can remain in the air for minutes to hours. This is called airborne (or aerosol) transmission, and it occurs especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. However, it is more common for COVID-19 to spread through close contact. Less often, the illness can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it, and then touch your eyes, nose, mouth, or face. But this is thought to be a much less common way in which the virus spreads. COVID-19 can spread from person to person quickly. As the virus spreads, it can change, and new variants of the virus will occur. Different variants may spread more quickly or be more resistant to treatments or vaccines. Taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, such as by getting a COVID-19 vaccine, can help slow the development of new variants. While the United States Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency has ended, COVID-19 is still a health concern, in particular for people at high risk of serious illness.","COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. Older people and people with certain existing health conditions have a higher risk of developing severe illness and death. Health conditions that increase this risk include: Asthma (if it's moderate or severe) Cancer COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Cystic fibrosis Dementia Diabetes (type 1 and type 2) Down syndrome or other disabilities Heart disease and stroke HIV Kidney , lung , or liver disease Mental health conditions Overweight and obesity (BMI of 25 kg per square meter or above) Physical inactivity Pregnancy Organ or stem cell transplantation Sickle cell disease or thalassemia Smoking (current or former) Substance use disorders Tuberculosis Weak immune system (immunocompromised) Symptoms of COVID-19 may include: Fever Chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle aches Headache Loss of sense of taste or smell Sore throat Stuffy or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea This is not a complete list of possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new variants of the virus. Some people may have no symptoms at all. Many people have some, but not all of these symptoms. Symptoms can also vary, depending on whether you are vaccinated and boosted. Symptoms may appear within 2 to 14 days after being exposed. Most often, symptoms appear around 5 days after exposure. However, you can spread the virus even when you do not have symptoms. More severe symptoms that require seeking medical help right away include: Trouble breathing Chest pain or pressure that persists Confusion or inability to wake up Blue lips or face Any other symptoms that are severe or that concern you",,Coronavirus - 2019; Coronavirus - novel 2019; 2019 Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2

Here are some tips to help ease your cough: If you have a dry, tickling cough, try cough drops or hard candy. Never give these to a child under age 3, because they can cause choking. Use a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to increase moisture in the air to help soothe a dry throat. If you use a humidifier, make sure it is properly cleaned and maintained. Drink plenty of fluids. Liquids help thin the mucus in your throat making it easier to cough it up. Do not smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke. Medicines you can buy on your own include: Guaifenesin helps break up mucus. Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount. Drink lots of fluids if you take this medicine. Decongestants help clear a runny nose and relieve postnasal drip. Check with your provider before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure. Talk to your child's provider before you give children ages 6 years or younger an over-the-counter cough medicine, even if it is labeled for children. These medicines likely do not work for children, and can have serious side effects. If you have seasonal allergies, such as hay fever: Stay indoors during days or times of the day (usually the morning) when airborne allergens are high. Keep windows closed and use an air conditioner. Do not use fans that draw in air from outdoors. Shower and change your clothes after being outside. If you have allergies year-round, cover your pillows and mattress with dust mite covers, use an air purifier, and avoid pets with fur and other triggers. Treat the underlying cause (per above) as directed by your provider.",

They may include: No ""soft spot"" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull A raised hard ridge along the affected sutures Unusual head shape Slow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows Types of craniosynostosis are: Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls. Frontal plagiocephaly is the next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It usually occurs on just one side, causing a flattened forehead, raised eyebrow, and prominent ear on that side. The baby's nose may also appear to be pulled toward that side. This is more common in girls than in boys. Metopic synostosis is a rare form that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, because the top of the head appears triangular, with a narrow or pointed forehead. It may range from mild to severe.",,Premature closure of sutures; Synostosis; Plagiocephaly; Scaphocephaly; Fontanelle - craniosynostosis; Soft spot - craniosynostosis

Creeping eruption,Creeping eruption is a human infection with dog or cat hookworm larvae (immature worms).,"Hookworm eggs are found in the stool of infected dogs and cats. When the eggs hatch, the larvae can infest soil and vegetation. When you come into contact with this infested soil, the larvae can burrow into your skin. They cause an intense inflammatory response that leads to a rash and severe itching. Creeping eruption is more common in countries with warm climates. In the United States, the Southeast has the highest rates of infection. The main risk factor for this disease is contact with damp, sandy soil that has been contaminated with infected cat or dog stool. More children than adults become infected.","Symptoms of creeping eruption include: Blisters Itching, may be more severe at night Raised, snakelike tracks in the skin that may spread over time, usually about 1 cm (less than one half inch) per day, usually on the feet and legs (severe infections may cause several tracks)",,Parasite infection - hookworm; Cutaneous larvae migrans; Zoonotic hookworm; Ancylostoma caninum; Ancylostoma braziliensis; Bunostomum phlebotomum; Uncinaria stenocephala
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a form of brain damage that leads to a rapid decrease in movement and loss of mental function.,"CJD is caused by a protein called a prion. A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects other proteins' ability to function. CJD is very rare. There are several types. The classic types of CJD are: Sporadic CJD makes up most cases. It occurs for no known reason. It starts on average at age 65 years. Familial CJD occurs when a person inherits the abnormal prion from a parent (this form of CJD is rare). Acquired CJD includes variant CJD (vCJD), the form related to mad cow disease. Variant CJD is caused by eating infected meat. The infection that causes the disease in cows is thought to be the same one that causes vCJD in humans. Variant CJD causes less than 1% of all CJD cases. It tends to affect younger people. Fewer than 200 people worldwide have had this disease. Almost all cases occurred in England and France. Iatrogenic CJD is also an acquired form of the disease. Iatrogenic CJD is sometimes passed through a blood product transfusion, transplant, or contaminated surgical instruments. CJD may be related to several other diseases caused by prions, including: Chronic wasting disease (found in deer) Kuru (affected mostly women in New Guinea who ate the brains of dead relatives as part of a funeral ritual) Scrapie (found in sheep) Other very rare inherited human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia","CJD symptoms may include any of the following: Dementia that gets worse quickly over a few weeks or months Blurred vision (sometimes) Changes in gait (walking) Confusion , disorientation Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) Lack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling) Muscle stiffness, twitching Feeling nervous, jumpy Personality changes Sleepiness Sudden jerky movements or seizures Trouble speaking",,Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; vCJD; CJD; Jacob-Creutzfeldt disease
Cri du chat syndrome,"Cri du chat syndrome is a group of symptoms that result from missing a piece of chromosome number 5. The syndrome's name is based on the infant's cry, which is high-pitched and sounds like a cat.","Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5. Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child.","Symptoms include: Cry that is high-pitched and may sound like a cat Downward slant to the eyes Epicanthal folds , an extra fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye Low birth weight and slow growth Low-set or abnormally shaped ears Hearing loss Heart defects Intellectual disability Partial webbing or fusing of fingers or toes Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) Single line in the palm of the hand Skin tags just in front of the ear Slow or incomplete development of motor skills Small head ( microcephaly ) Small jaw ( micrognathia ) Wide-set eyes",,Chromosome 5p deletion syndrome; 5p minus syndrome; Cat cry syndrome
Crigler-Najjar syndrome,Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a very rare inherited disorder in which bilirubin cannot be broken down. Bilirubin is a substance made by the liver.,"An enzyme converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body. Crigler-Najjar syndrome occurs when this enzyme does not work correctly. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to: Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and eyes) Damage to the brain, muscles, and nerves Type I Crigler-Najjar is the form of the disease that starts early in life. Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome may start later in life. The syndrome runs in families (inherited). A child must receive a copy of the variant gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition. Parents who are carriers (with just one variant gene) have about one half the enzyme activity of a normal adult, but do not have symptoms.","Symptoms may include: Confusion and changes in thinking Yellow skin (jaundice) and yellow in the whites of the eyes (icterus), which begin a few days after birth and get worse over time Lethargy Poor feeding Vomiting",,Glucuronyl transferase deficiency (type I Crigler-Najjar); Arias syndrome (type II Crigler-Najjar)
Crohn disease,Crohn disease is a disease where parts of the digestive tract become inflamed.,"The exact cause of Crohn disease is unknown. It occurs when your body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorder), mainly in the digestive tract. When parts of the digestive tract remain swollen or inflamed, the walls of the intestines become thickened. Factors that may play a role in Crohn disease include: Your genes and family history. (People who are white or of Eastern European Jewish descent are at a higher risk.) Environmental factors. Tendency of your body to over-react to normal bacteria in the intestines. Smoking. Crohn disease may occur at any age. It mostly begins in people between ages 15 and 35.","Symptoms depend on the part of the digestive tract involved. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and can come and go, with periods of flare-ups. The main symptoms of Crohn disease are: Crampy pain in the abdomen (belly area). Fever. Fatigue. Loss of appetite and weight loss. Feeling that you need to pass stools, even though your bowels are already empty (tenesmus). It may involve straining, pain, and cramping. Watery diarrhea, which may be bloody. Other symptoms may include: Constipation Sores or swelling in the eyes Draining of pus, mucus, or stools from around the rectum or anus (caused by something called a fistula ) Joint pain and swelling Mouth ulcers Rectal bleeding and bloody stools Swollen gums Tender, red bumps (nodules) under the skin, which may turn into skin ulcers",,Crohn's disease; Inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's disease; Regional enteritis; Ileitis; Granulomatous ileocolitis; IBD - Crohn disease
Croup,Croup is an infection of the upper airways that causes breathing difficulty and a barking cough. Croup is due to swelling around the vocal cords. It is common in infants and children.,"Croup affects children ages 3 months to 5 years. It can occur at any age. Some children are more likely to get croup and may get it several times. It is most common between October and April, but can occur at any time of the year. Croup is most often caused by viruses such as parainfluenza RSV, measles, adenovirus, and influenza. More severe cases of croup may be caused by bacteria. This condition is called bacterial tracheitis . Croup-like symptoms may also be caused by: Allergies Breathing in something that irritates your airway Acid reflux","The main symptom of croup is a cough that sounds like a seal barking. Most children will have a mild cold and a low grade fever for several days before having barking cough and a hoarse voice. As the cough gets more frequent, the child may have trouble breathing or stridor (a harsh, crowing noise made when breathing in). Croup is typically much worse at night. It often lasts 3 to 7 nights. The first night or two are most often the worst. Rarely, croup can last for weeks. Talk to your child's health care provider if croup lasts longer than a week or comes back often.",,Viral croup; Laryngotracheobronchitis; Spasmodic croup; Barking cough; Laryngotracheitis

Cryoglobulinemia,Cryoglobulinemia is the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood. These proteins thicken in cold temperatures.,"Cryoglobulins are antibodies . It is not yet known why they become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. In the body, these antibodies can form immune complexes that can cause inflammation and block blood vessels. This is called cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. This may lead to problems ranging from skin rashes to kidney failure. Cryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body (vasculitis). There are three main types of this condition. They are grouped based on the type of antibody that is produced: Type I Type II Type III Type I cryoglobulinemia is most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems. Types II and III are also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia . Types II and III are most often found in people who have a long-lasting (chronic) inflammatory condition, such as an autoimmune disease or hepatitis C. Most people with the type II form of cryoglobulinemia have a chronic hepatitis C infection. Other conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include: Leukemia Multiple myeloma Primary macroglobulinemia Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus","Symptoms will vary, depending on the type of disorder you have and the organs that are involved.

Infection with C neoformans is seen worldwide. Infection with C gattii has mainly been seen in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, British Columbia in Canada, Southeast Asia, and Australia. In the United States, sporadic cases have been seen in many states including Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Hawaii, Georgia, Rhode Island, and Florida. Cryptococcus is the most common fungus that causes serious infection worldwide. Both types of fungi are found in soil. If you breathe the fungus in, it infects your lungs. The infection may go away on its own, remain in the lungs only, or spread throughout the body (disseminate). C neoformans infection is most often seen in people with a weak immune system, such as those who: Are infected with HIV/AIDS Take corticosteroid medicines Cancer Are on chemotherapy medicines for cancer Have Hodgkin disease Have had an organ transplant C gattii may affect people with normal immune system. C neoformans is the most common life-threatening cause of fungal infection in people with HIV/AIDS. People between 20 to 40 years of age are the most common age group that has this infection.","The infection may spread to the brain in people who have a weakened immune system. Neurological (brain) symptoms start slowly. Most people have swelling and irritation of the brain and spinal cord when they are diagnosed. Symptoms of brain infection may include: Fever and headache Neck stiffness Nausea and vomiting Blurred vision or double vision Confusion The infection can also affect the lungs and other organs. Lung symptoms may include: Difficulty in breathing Cough Chest pain Other symptoms may include: Bone pain or tenderness of the breastbone Fatigue Skin rash , including pinpoint red spots ( petechiae ), ulcers, or other skin lesions Sweating -- unusual, excessive at night Swollen glands Unintentional weight loss People with a healthy immune system may have no symptoms at all.",,C. neoformans var. neoformans infection; C. neoformans var. gatti infection; C. neoformans var. grubii infection

Curvature of the penis,"Curvature of the penis is an abnormal bend in the penis that occurs during erection. In adults, it is most often due to Peyronie disease.","In Peyronie disease, fibrous scar tissue develops in the deep tissues of the penis. The cause of this fibrous tissue is often not known. It can occur spontaneously. It can also be due to a previous injury to the penis, even one that occurred many years ago. Fracture of the penis (injury during intercourse) can lead to this condition. Men are at higher risk for developing curvature of the penis after surgery or radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Peyronie disease is uncommon. It affects men ages 40 and older. Curvature of the penis can occur along with Dupuytren contracture . This is a cord-like thickening across the palm of one or both hands. It is a fairly common disorder in white men over age 50. However, only a very small number of people with Dupuytren contracture develop curvature of the penis. Other risk factors have not been found. However, people with this condition have a certain type of immune cell marker, which indicates that it may be inherited. Newborns may have a curvature of the penis. This may be part of an abnormality called chordee, which is different from Peyronie disease.","You or your health care provider may notice an abnormal hardening of the tissue below the skin, in one area along the shaft of the penis. It may also feel like a hard lump or bump.

Cushing disease,Cushing disease is a condition in which the pituitary gland releases too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The pituitary gland is an organ of the endocrine system.,"Cushing disease is caused by a tumor or excess growth ( hyperplasia ) of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located just below the base of the brain. A type of pituitary tumor called an adenoma is the most common cause. An adenoma is a benign tumor (not a cancer). With Cushing disease, the pituitary gland releases too much ACTH. ACTH stimulates production and release of cortisol, a stress hormone. Too much ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. Cortisol is normally released during stressful situations. It also has many other functions, including: Controlling the body's use of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins Reducing the immune system's response to swelling (inflammation) Regulating blood pressure and the body's water balance","Symptoms of Cushing disease include: Upper body obesity (above the waist) and thin arms and legs Round, red, full face ( moon face ) Slow growth rate in children Skin changes that are often seen include: Acne or skin infections Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae , on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts Thin skin with easy bruising, most commonly on the arms and hands Muscle and bone changes include: Backache, which occurs with routine activities Bone pain or tenderness Collection of fat between the shoulders ( buffalo hump ) Weakening of the bones, which leads to rib and spine fractures Weak muscles causing exercise intolerance Women may have: Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs Menstrual cycle that becomes irregular or stops Men may have: Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido) Erection problems Other symptoms or problems may include: Mental changes , such as depression, anxiety, or changes in behavior Fatigue Frequent infections Headache Increased thirst and urination High blood pressure Diabetes (high blood sugar)",,Pituitary Cushing disease; ACTH-secreting adenoma
Cushing syndrome,Cushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a high level of the hormone cortisol.,"The most common cause of Cushing syndrome is taking too much glucocorticoid or corticosteroid medicine. This form of Cushing syndrome is called exogenous Cushing syndrome . Prednisone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone are examples of this type of medicine. Glucocorticoids mimic the action of the body's natural hormone cortisol. These drugs are used to treat many conditions such as asthma, skin inflammation, cancer, bowel disease, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. Other people develop Cushing syndrome because their body produces too much cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands. Causes of too much cortisol are: Cushing disease , which occurs when the pituitary gland makes too much of the hormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. A pituitary gland tumor can cause this condition. Tumor of the adrenal gland Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) Tumor elsewhere in the body that produces ACTH ( ectopic Cushing syndrome )","Not everyone with Cushing syndrome has the same symptoms. Some people have many symptoms while others have hardly any symptoms. Symptoms usually get worse over time. Most people with Cushing syndrome have: Round, red, full face ( moon face ) Slow growth rate (in children) Weight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity) Skin changes can include: Skin infections Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide) called striae on the skin of the abdomen, upper arms, thighs, and breasts Thin skin with easy bruising (especially on the arms and hands) Muscle and bone changes include: Backache, which occurs with routine activities Bone pain or tenderness Collection of fat between the shoulders and above collar bones Rib and spine fractures caused by thinning of the bones Weak muscles, especially of the hips and shoulders Body-wide (systemic) changes include: Type 2 diabetes mellitus High blood pressure (hypertension) Increased cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia) Women with Cushing syndrome may have: Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs Periods that become irregular or stop Men may have: Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido) Erection problems Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Mental changes, such as depression, anxiety, or changes in behavior Fatigue Headache Increased thirst and urination",,Hypercortisolism; Cortisol excess; Glucocorticoid excess - Cushing syndrome; Cushing's syndrome
Cushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor,Cushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor is a form of Cushing syndrome. It occurs when a tumor of the adrenal gland releases excess amounts of the hormone cortisol.,"Cushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands . Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One such problem is a tumor on one of the adrenal glands. Adrenal tumors release cortisol. Adrenal tumors are rare. They can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Noncancerous tumors that can cause Cushing syndrome include: Adrenal adenomas, a common tumor that rarely makes excess cortisol Macronodular hyperplasia , which causes the adrenal glands to enlarge and make excess cortisol Cancerous tumors that may cause Cushing syndrome include an adrenal carcinoma. This is a rare tumor, but it usually makes excess cortisol.","Most people with Cushing syndrome have: Round, red, full face ( moon face ) Slow growth rate in children Weight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity) Skin changes that are often seen: Skin infections Purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide), called striae , on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts Thin skin with easy bruising Muscle and bone changes include: Backache, which occurs with routine activities Bone pain or tenderness Collection of fat between the shoulders and above the collar bone Rib and spine fractures caused by thinning of the bones Weak muscles, especially of the hips and shoulders Body-wide (systemic) changes include: Type 2 diabetes mellitus High blood pressure Increased cholesterol and triglycerides Women often have: Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs (more common than in other types of Cushing syndrome) Periods that become irregular or stop Men may have: Decreased or no desire for sex (low libido) Erection problems Other symptoms that may occur include: Mental changes, such as depression , anxiety, or changes in behavior Fatigue Headache Increased thirst and urination",,Adrenal tumor - Cushing syndrome; Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal tumor

Cyanotic heart disease,Cyanotic heart disease refers to a group of many different heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). They result in a low blood oxygen level. Cyanosis refers to a bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes.,"Normally, blood returns from the body and flows through the heart and lungs. Blood that is low in oxygen returns from the body to the right side of the heart. The right side of the heart then pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up more oxygen and becomes red. The oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body. Heart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. These defects can cause less blood to flow to the lungs. They can also result in blue and red blood mixing together. This causes poorly oxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body. As a result: The blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen. Less oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue ( cyanosis ). Some of these heart defects involve the heart valves. These defects force blue blood to mix with red blood through abnormal heart channels. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward. Heart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include: Tricuspid valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the right side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. Pulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs) may be absent or unable to open wide enough . Aortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough. Mitral valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. This is very rare and a poorly formed left ventricle may also be present. Other heart defects may include abnormalities in valve development or in the location and connections between blood vessels. Some examples include: Coarctation or complete interruption of the aorta Ebstein anomaly Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous return Transposition of the great arteries Truncus arteriosus Certain medical conditions in the mother can increase the risk of certain cyanotic heart diseases in the infant. Some examples include: Chemical exposure Genetic and chromosomal syndromes, such as Down syndrome , trisomy 13 , Turner syndrome , Marfan syndrome , and Noonan syndrome Infections (such as rubella ) during pregnancy Poorly controlled blood sugar level in women who have diabetes during pregnancy Medicines prescribed by your health care provider or bought on your own and used during pregnancy Street drugs used during pregnancy","Some heart defects cause major problems right after birth. The main symptom of cyanosis is a bluish color of the lips, fingers, and toes that is caused by the low oxygen content in the blood. It may occur while the child is resting or only when the child is active. Some children have breathing problems (dyspnea). They may get into a squatting position after physical activity to relieve breathlessness. Others have spells, in which their bodies are suddenly starved of oxygen. During these spells, symptoms may include: Anxiety Breathing too quickly (hyperventilation) Sudden increase in bluish color to the skin Infants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should. Fainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur. Other symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include: Feeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Puffy eyes or face Tiredness all the time",,Right-to-left cardiac shunt; Right-to-left circulatory shunt
Cyclothymic disorder,"Cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder. It is a mild form of bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness), in which a person has mood swings over a period of years that go from mild depression to emotional highs.","The causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown. Major depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families. This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes. Cyclothymia usually begins early in life. Men and women are equally affected.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Periods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (hypomanic symptoms), or low mood, activity, or energy (depressive symptoms) for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents). These mood swings are less severe than with bipolar disorder or major depression. Ongoing symptoms, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row.",,Cyclothymia; Mood disorder - cyclothymia
Cyproheptadine overdose,Cyproheptadine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine. These medicines are used to relieve allergy symptoms. Cyproheptadine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.,,"Below are symptoms of a cyproheptadine overdose in different parts of the body. BLADDER AND KIDNEYS Inability to urinate Difficulty urinating EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT Blurred vision Dilated (wide) pupils Dry mouth Ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS Rapid heartbeat Increased blood pressure NERVOUS SYSTEM Agitation Coma (lack of responsiveness) Convulsions (seizures) Delirium (acute confusion) Disorientation, hallucinations Drowsiness Fever Irregular or rapid heartbeat Nervousness Tremor (shaking) Unsteadiness , weakness SKIN Flushed and dry skin STOMACH AND INTESTINES Constipation Nausea and vomiting",,

Cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas. The buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system. Many people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because for a person to get CF, they must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent. Most children with CF are diagnosed by age 2, especially as newborn screening is performed across the United States. For a small number, the disease is not detected until age 18 or older. These children often have a milder form of the disease.","Symptoms in newborns may include: Delayed growth Failure to gain weight normally during childhood No bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life Salty-tasting skin Symptoms related to bowel function may include: Belly pain from severe constipation Increased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended) Nausea and loss of appetite Stools that are pale or clay-colored , foul smelling, have mucus, or that float Weight loss History of rectal prolapse Symptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include: Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs Fatigue Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite) Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps Symptoms that may be noticed later in life: Infertility (in men) Repeated inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) Respiratory symptoms Clubbed fingers",,CF
Cystic fibrosis - nutrition,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract. People with CF need to eat foods that are high in calories and protein throughout the day.",,,,
Cystic fibrosis - resources,The following organizations are good resources for information on cystic fibrosis:,,,,
Cystic hygroma,A cystic hygroma is a growth that often occurs in the head and neck area. It is a birth defect.,"A cystic hygroma occurs as the baby grows in the womb. It forms from pieces of material that carry fluid and white blood cells. This material is called embryonic lymphatic tissue . After birth, a cystic hygroma most often looks like a soft bulge under the skin. The cyst may not be found at birth. It typically grows as the child grows. Sometimes it is not noticed until the child is older.","A common symptom is a neck growth. It may be found at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection (such as a cold).",,Lymphangioma; Lymphatic malformation
Cysticercosis,Cysticercosis is an infection by a parasite called Taenia solium (T solium). It is a pork tapeworm that creates cysts in different areas of the body.,"Cysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from T solium . The eggs are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection is when a person who is already infected with adult T solium swallows its eggs. This occurs due to improper hand washing after a bowel movement (fecal-oral transmission). Risk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with T solium as a result of undercooking or improper food preparation . The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces. The disease is rare in the United States. It is common in many developing countries.","Most often, the worms stay in muscles and do not cause symptoms. Symptoms occur depending on where the infection is found in the body: Brain -- seizures or symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor Eyes -- decreased vision or blindness Heart -- abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure (rare) Spine -- weakness or changes in walking due to damage to nerves in the spine",,
Cystinuria,"Cystinuria is a rare condition in which stones made from an amino acid called cysteine form in the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Cystine is formed when two molecules of an amino acid called cysteine are bound together. The condition is passed down through families.","To have the symptoms of cystinuria, you must inherit a variant gene from both parents. Your children will also inherit a copy of the variant gene from you. Cystinuria is caused by too much cystine in the urine. Normally, most cystine dissolves and returns to the bloodstream after entering the kidneys. People with cystinuria have a genetic change that interferes with this process. As a result, cystine builds up in the urine and forms crystals or stones. These crystals may get stuck in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. About one in every 7000 people have cystinuria. Cystine stones are most common in young adults under age 40. Less than 3% of urinary tract stones are cystine stones.","Symptoms include: Blood in the urine Flank pain or pain in the side or back. Pain is most often on one side. It is rarely felt on both sides. Pain is often severe. It may get worse over days. You may also feel pain in the pelvis, groin, genitals, or between the upper abdomen and back.",,Stones - cystine; Cystine stones
Cystitis - acute,Acute cystitis is an infection of the bladder or lower urinary tract. Acute means that the infection begins suddenly.,"Cystitis is caused by germs, most often bacteria. These germs enter the urethra and then the bladder and can cause an infection. The infection commonly develops in the bladder. It can also spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria when you urinate. But, the bacteria can stick to the wall of the urethra or bladder, or grow so fast that some stay in the bladder. Women tend to get infections more often than men. This happens because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse. Using a diaphragm for birth control can also be a cause. Menopause also increases the risk for a urinary tract infection. The following also increase your chances of having cystitis: A tube called a urinary catheter inserted in your bladder Blockage of the bladder or urethra Diabetes Enlarged prostate , narrowed urethra , or anything that blocks the flow of urine Loss of bowel control ( bowel incontinence ) Older age (most often in people who live in nursing homes) Pregnancy Problems fully emptying your bladder (urinary retention) Procedures that involve the urinary tract Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, when you are recovering from a hip fracture ) Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli ( E coli ) . It is a type of bacteria found in the intestines.","The symptoms of a bladder infection include: Cloudy or bloody urine Strong or foul-smelling urine Low fever (most people will not have a fever) Pain or burning with urination Pressure or cramping in the lower middle abdomen or back Strong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied Often in an older person, mental changes or confusion are the only signs of a possible infection.",,Uncomplicated urinary tract infection; UTI - acute cystitis; Acute bladder infection; Acute bacterial cystitis
Cystitis - noninfectious,"Cystitis is a problem in which pain, pressure, or burning in the bladder is present. Most often, this problem is caused by germs such as bacteria. Cystitis is called noninfectious when there is no infection.","The exact cause of noninfectious cystitis is often not known. It is more common in women than men. The problem has been linked to: Use of baths and feminine hygiene sprays Use of spermicide jellies, gels, foams, and sponges Radiation therapy to the pelvis area Certain types of chemotherapy drugs History of severe or repeated bladder infections Certain foods, such as spicy or acidic foods, tomatoes, artificial sweeteners, caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol, can cause bladder symptoms. Stress may also make symptoms worse, but stress does not cause symptoms.","Common symptoms include: Pressure or pain in the lower pelvis Painful urination Frequent need to urinate Urgent need to urinate Problems holding urine Need to urinate at night Abnormal urine color , cloudy urine Blood in the urine Foul or strong urine odor Other symptoms may include: Pain during sexual intercourse Scrotum, penile, or vaginal pain Fatigue",,Abacterial cystitis; Radiation cystitis; Chemical cystitis; Urethral syndrome - acute; Bladder pain syndrome; Painful bladder disease complex; Dysuria - noninfectious cystitis; Frequent urination - noninfectious cystitis; Painful urination - noninfectious; Interstitial cystitis

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a disease caused by a type of herpes virus.,"Infection with CMV is very common. The infection is spread by: Blood transfusions Organ transplants Respiratory droplets Saliva Sexual contact Urine Tears Most people come into contact with CMV in their lifetime. But usually, it's people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, who become ill from CMV infection. Some otherwise healthy people with CMV infection develop a mononucleosis-like syndrome. CMV is a type of herpes virus. All herpes viruses remain in your body for the rest of your life after infection. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms.","Many people are exposed to CMV early in life, but do not realize it because they have no symptoms, or they have mild symptoms that resemble the common cold or flu. These may include: Enlarged lymph nodes, especially in the neck Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Malaise Muscle aches Rash Sore throat CMV can cause infections in different parts of the body. Symptoms vary depending on the area that is affected.

Deep vein thrombosis,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside a part of the body. DVT mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh, but can occur in other deep veins, such as in the arms and pelvis. DVT most often affects only one side of the body.","DVT is most common in adults over age 60. But it can occur at any age. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it is called an embolism. An embolism can get stuck in the blood vessels in the brain, lungs, heart, or another area, leading to severe damage. Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins. Risk factors include: A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through a vein in the groin Bed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane or car travel Family history of blood clots Fractures in the pelvis or legs Giving birth within the last 6 months Pregnancy Obesity Recent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery) Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal ( polycythemia vera ) Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vessel Age greater than 60 Blood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as: Cancer Certain autoimmune disorders , such as lupus Cigarette smoking Conditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots Taking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking) Sitting for long periods when traveling can increase the risk for DVT.

Puberty is often late in these children. These children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be ruled out. Genetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for their age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents. Delayed or slower-than-expected growth can be caused by many different things, including: Chronic disease Endocrine disorders Emotional health Infection Poor nutrition Many children with delayed growth also have delays in development.",,"If slow weight gain is due to a lack of calories, try feeding the child on demand.

Dementia may also be referred to as major neurocognitive disorder.","Dementia usually occurs in older age. Most types are rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older. Most types of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back. Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia. Another common type of dementia is vascular dementia . It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke. Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. Any condition that results in injury to the brain can cause dementia. The following medical conditions can also lead to dementia: Huntington disease Brain injury Frontotemporal degeneration (Pick disease) Multiple sclerosis Infections such as HIV/AIDS , syphilis , and Lyme disease Parkinson disease Progressive supranuclear palsy Excess alcohol use Brain trauma Some causes of dementia, such as those due to abnormal chemical processes in the body , may be stopped or reversed if they are found soon enough, including: Brain injury Brain tumors Long-term (chronic) alcohol abuse Changes in blood sugar, sodium, and calcium levels Low vitamin B12 level Normal pressure hydrocephalus Use of certain medicines, including cimetidine and some cholesterol medicines Some brain infections","Dementia symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including: Emotional behavior or personality Language Memory Perception Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills) Dementia usually first appears as forgetfulness. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They often know about their forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia. Symptoms of MCI include: Difficulty doing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems or making decisions Forgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of dementia can include: Difficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objects Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior Poor performance of job duties As dementia becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Difficulty with basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving Forgetting details about current events Wandering and getting lost Forgetting events in one's own life history, or losing self-awareness Having hallucinations , arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Having delusions, depression , and agitation More difficulty reading or writing Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact People with severe dementia can no longer: Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing Recognize family members Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with dementia: Problems controlling bowel movements or urine Swallowing problems",,Lewy body dementia; DLB; Vascular dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; MCI; Alzheimer disease - dementia

Dengue fever,"Dengue fever is a virus-caused disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Dengue in its mild form causes fever and a rash and lasts about a week. Severe dengue can cause shock, internal bleeding, and death. About 1 out of 20 people with dengue will develop severe dengue within a few hours after symptoms start. The main risk factor for severe dengue is a prior infection with dengue.","Dengue fever is caused by 1 of 4 different but related viruses. It is spread by the bite of mosquitoes, most commonly the mosquito Aedes aegypti , which is found in tropic and subtropic regions. This area includes parts of: The Indonesian archipelago into northeastern Australia South and Central America Southeast Asia Sub-Saharan Africa The Caribbean (including Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) Dengue fever is rare in the US mainland, but has been found in Hawaii, Florida, and Texas. Since 2022, dengue has also been reported in California and Arizona. Many cases in the United States occur when someone travels to an area where dengue is present and returns home with the illness. Dengue cannot spread from human to human.","Dengue fever begins with a sudden high fever, often as high as 105°F (40.5°C), 4 to 7 days after the infection. A flat, red rash may appear over most of the body 2 to 5 days after the fever starts. A second rash, which looks like the measles , appears later in the disease. Infected people may have increased skin sensitivity and are very uncomfortable. Other symptoms include: Fatigue Headache (especially behind the eyes) Joint aches (often severe) Muscle aches (often severe) Nausea and vomiting Swollen lymph nodes Cough Sore throat Nasal stuffiness Symptoms of severe dengue can occur 24 to 48 hours after fever has gone away.

Dental cavities,Dental cavities are holes (or structural damage) in the teeth.,"Tooth decay is a very common disorder. It most often occurs in children and young adults, but it can affect anyone. Tooth decay is a common cause of tooth loss in younger people. Bacteria are normally found in your mouth. These bacteria change foods, especially sugar and starch, into acids. Bacteria, acid, food pieces, and saliva combine in the mouth to form a sticky substance called plaque. Plaque sticks to the teeth. It is most common on the back molars, just above the gum line on all teeth, and at the edges of fillings. Plaque that is not removed from the teeth turns into a substance called tartar, or calculus. Plaque and tartar irritate the gums, resulting in gingivitis and periodontitis . Plaque begins to build up on teeth within 20 minutes after eating. If it is not removed, it will harden and turn into tartar (calculus). The acids in plaque damage the enamel covering your teeth. It also creates holes in the tooth called cavities. Cavities usually do not hurt, unless they grow very large and affect nerves or cause a tooth fracture. An untreated cavity can lead to an infection in the tooth called a tooth abscess . Untreated tooth decay also destroys the inside of the tooth (pulp). This requires more extensive treatment, or possibly removal of the tooth. Carbohydrates (sugars and starches) increase the risk of tooth decay. Sticky foods are more harmful than non-sticky foods because they remain on the teeth. Frequent snacking increases the time that acids are in contact with the surface of the tooth.","There may be no symptoms.

Developmental differences of the female genital tract,Developmental differences of the female reproductive tract affect the reproductive organs of a female infant. They occur while the baby is growing in the mother's womb.,"A baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This continues until the 20th week of pregnancy. This development is a complex process. Many things can affect this process. The severity of the differences depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, if the problems occur earlier in the womb, the effect will be more widespread. Problems in the development of female reproductive organs may be caused by: Missing or damaged genes (genetic variance) Exposure to certain medicines during pregnancy Some babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal gland needs this enzyme to make hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. This condition is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia . If a developing female infant lacks this enzyme, the infant will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. However, the external genitals will have a more male-like appearance. Some babies with this syndrome have difficulties with the concentration of salts in their urine. It is very important that this issue be diagnosed early. Certain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development. One medicine known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Health care providers once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that female infants born to women who took this medicine had an abnormally shaped uterus. The medicine also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer. In some cases, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the person is older. The reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas. These areas may include the urinary tract, kidneys, intestine, and lower spine. Developmental differences of the female reproductive tract include: Differences of sex development (DSD) Ambiguous genitalia Other developmental differences of the female reproductive tract include: Cloacal abnormalities - The cloaca is a tube-like structure in an unborn baby. In the early stages of development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this single tube. Later, the 3 areas separate and have their own openings. If the cloaca persists as a female infant grows in the womb, all the openings do not form and separate. For example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. Urine and feces may have difficulty leaving the body. This can cause stomach swelling. Some cloacal abnormalities may cause a female infant to look like they have a penis. These birth defects are rare. Problems with external genitals - Developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia. Fused labia is a condition where the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together. Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to DSD and ambiguous genitalia. Imperforate hymen - The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. This often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. Sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny, small holes. This problem may not be discovered until puberty. Some female infants are born without a hymen. This is considered to be a normal variation in development. Ovarian problems - A female infant may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue. Uterus and cervix problems - A female infant may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, females born with a half-formed uterus and vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body. More commonly, the uterus can form with a central ""wall"" or septum in the upper portion of the uterus. A variant of this defect occurs when the infant is born with a single cervix but two uteri. The upper uteri sometimes do not communicate with the cervix. This leads to swelling and pain. All uterine abnormalities can lead to fertility issues. Vaginal problems - A female infant may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. In this syndrome, the infant is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs (uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes). Other abnormalities include having 2 vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract. Some females may have a heart-shaped uterus or a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity.","Symptoms vary according to the specific problem. They may include: Breasts that do not grow Inability to empty the bladder Lump in the pelvic area, usually due to blood or mucus that cannot flow out of the uterus Menstrual flow that occurs despite using a tampon (a sign of a second vagina) Monthly cramping or pain, without menstruation No menstruation ( amenorrhea ) Pain with sex Repeated miscarriages or preterm births (may be due to an abnormal uterus)",,"Congenital defect - vagina, ovaries, uterus, and cervix; Birth defect - vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix; Developmental disorder of female reproductive tract"
Developmental dysplasia of the hip,Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a dislocation of the hip joint that is present at birth. The condition is found in babies or young children.,"The hip is a ball and socket joint. The ball is called the femoral head. It forms the top part of the thigh bone (femur). The socket (acetabulum) forms in the pelvic bone. In some newborns, the socket is too shallow and the ball (thigh bone) may slip out of the socket, either part of the way or completely. One or both hips may be involved. The cause is unknown. Low levels of amniotic fluid in the womb during pregnancy can increase a baby's risk for DDH. Other risk factors include: Being the first child Being female Breech position during pregnancy, in which the baby's bottom is down Family history of the disorder Large birth weight DDH occurs in about 1 to 1.5 of 1,000 births.","There may be no symptoms.

DRD may appear with other problems. These can include developmental writing disorder and developmental arithmetic disorder . The condition often runs in families.,"A person with DRD may have trouble rhyming and separating sounds that make up spoken words. These abilities affect learning to read. A child's early reading skills are based on word recognition. That involves being able to separate out the sounds in words and match them with letters and groups of letters. People with DRD have trouble connecting the sounds of language to the letters of words. This may also create problems in understanding sentences. True dyslexia is much broader than simply confusing or transposing letters. For example, mistaking a ""b"" and a ""d.""

Many types involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area. In the simplest type of dextrocardia, the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart and there are no other problems. This condition is rare. When this occurs, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will often also be arranged in a mirror image. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right. Some people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages. This condition is called Kartagener syndrome. In the more common types of dextrocardia, other heart defects are also present. The most common of these include: Double outlet right ventricle (the aorta connects to the right ventricle instead of to the left ventricle) Endocardial cushion defect (the walls separating all 4 chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent) Pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve) or atresia (pulmonary valve does not form properly) Single ventricle (instead of two ventricles, there is a single ventricle) Transposition of the great vessels (the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched) Ventricular septal defect (hole in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart) The abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. In this condition, many of the organs are not in their usual places and may not work properly. For example, the spleen may be completely missing. The spleen is an important part of the immune system, so babies born without this organ are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy, several small spleens exist, but they may not work correctly. Heterotaxy may also include: Abnormal gallbladder system Problems with the lungs Problems with the structure or position of the intestines Severe heart defects Abnormalities of the blood vessels Possible risk factors for dextrocardia include a family history of the condition.",There are no symptoms of dextrocardia if the heart is normal. Conditions that may include dextrocardia may cause the following symptoms: Bluish skin ( cyanosis ) Difficulty breathing Failure to grow and gain weight Fatigue Yellow skin and eyes ( jaundice ) Pale skin ( pallor ) Repeated sinus or lung infections,,Cyanotic heart defect - dextrocardia; Congenital heart defect - dextrocardia; Birth defect - dextrocardia

Diabetes,Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.,"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both. To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed: A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance) Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown. Type 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.","A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including: Blurry vision Excess thirst Fatigue Frequent urination Hunger Weight loss Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed. After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include: Eye problems , including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot Damage to nerves in the body , causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction Kidney problems , which can lead to kidney failure Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke",,Diabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus

Diabetes and eye disease,"Diabetes can harm the eyes. It can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, the back part of your eye. This condition is called diabetic retinopathy.","Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage from diabetes to blood vessels of the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals, which are sent to the brain. Diabetic retinopathy is a main cause of decreased vision or blindness in Americans ages 20 to 74 years. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for this condition. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have eye damage when they are first diagnosed. Watch this video about: Diabetes - retinal conditions The chance of developing retinopathy and having a more severe form is higher when: You have had diabetes for a long time. Your blood sugar (glucose) has been poorly controlled. You also smoke or you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol. If you already have damage to the blood vessels in your eye, some types of exercise can make the problem worse. Check with your health care provider before starting an exercise program. Other eye problems that can occur in people with diabetes include: Cataract -- Cloudiness of the eye lens. Glaucoma -- Increased pressure in the eye that can lead to blindness. Macular edema -- Blurry vision due to fluid leaking into the area of the retina that provides sharp central vision. Retinal detachment -- Scarring that may cause part of the retina to pull away from the back of your eyeball. High blood sugar or rapid changes in blood sugar level often cause blurred vision that is usually brief and temporary. This is because the lens in the middle of the eye cannot change shape when it has too much sugar and water in the lens. This is not the same problem as diabetic retinopathy.","Most often, diabetic retinopathy has no symptoms until the damage to your eyes is severe. This is because damage to much of the retina can occur before your vision is affected. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include: Blurred vision and slow vision loss over time Floaters Shadows or missing areas of vision Trouble seeing at night Many people with early diabetic retinopathy have no symptoms before bleeding occurs in the eye. This is why everyone with diabetes should have regular eye exams.",,Retinopathy - diabetic; Photocoagulation - retina; Diabetic retinopathy
Diabetes and kidney disease,Kidney disease or kidney damage often occurs over time in people with diabetes. This type of kidney disease is called diabetic nephropathy.,"Each kidney is made of hundreds of thousands of small units called nephrons. These structures filter your blood, help remove waste from the body, and control fluid balance. In people with diabetes , the nephrons slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The nephrons begin to leak, and protein (albumin) passes into the urine. This damage can happen years before any symptoms of kidney disease begin. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have kidney damage when they are first diagnosed. Kidney damage is more likely if you: Have uncontrolled blood sugar (glucose) Are obese Have high blood pressure Have type 1 diabetes that began before you were 20 years old Have family members who also have diabetes and kidney problems Smoke Are African American, Mexican American, or Native American","Often, there are no symptoms as the kidney damage starts and slowly gets worse. Kidney damage can begin 5 to 10 years before symptoms start. People who have more severe and long-term (chronic) kidney disease may have symptoms such as: Fatigue most of the time General ill feeling Headache Irregular heartbeat Nausea and vomiting Poor appetite Swelling of the legs Shortness of breath Itchy skin Easily develop infections",,Diabetic nephropathy; Nephropathy - diabetic; Diabetic glomerulosclerosis; Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease
Diabetes and nerve damage,Nerve damage that occurs in people with diabetes is called diabetic neuropathy. This condition is a complication of diabetes.,"In people with diabetes, the body's nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar (glucose) level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled over time. About one half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some people who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for other nerve problems not caused by their diabetes. These other nerve problems won't have the same symptoms and will progress in a different manner than nerve damage caused by diabetes.","Symptoms often develop slowly over many years. The types of symptoms you have depend on the nerves that are affected. Nerves in the feet and legs are most often affected. Symptoms often start in the toes and feet, and include tingling or burning, or deep pain. Over time, nerve damage can also occur in the fingers and hands. As the damage gets worse, you may lose feeling in your toes, feet, and legs. Your skin may become numb. Because of this, you may: Not notice when you step on something sharp Not know that you have a blister or small cut Not notice when your feet or hands touch something that is too hot or cold Have feet that are very dry and cracked When the nerves that control digestion are affected, you may have trouble digesting food due to reduced movement of the stomach ( gastroparesis ). This can make your diabetes harder to control. Damage to nerves that control digestion almost always occurs in people with severe nerve damage in their feet and legs. Symptoms of digestion problems include: Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food Heartburn and bloating Nausea, constipation, or diarrhea Swallowing problems Throwing up undigested food a few hours after a meal When nerves in your heart and blood vessels are damaged, you may: Feel lightheaded when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension ) Have a fast heart rate Not notice angina , the chest pain that warns of heart disease and heart attack Other symptoms of nerve damage are: Sexual problems, which cause trouble getting an erection in men and vaginal dryness or orgasm problems in women. Not being able to tell when your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycemia unawareness). Bladder problems, which cause urine leakage or not being able to empty the bladder. Sweating too much, even when the temperature is cool, when you're at rest, or at other unusual times. Feet that are very sweaty (early nerve damage).",,Diabetic neuropathy; Diabetes - neuropathy; Diabetes - peripheral neuropathy
Diabetes insipidus,Diabetes insipidus (DI) is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water.,"During the day, your kidneys filter all your blood many times. Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine, relative to the volume of blood, is excreted. DI occurs when your kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted. The amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland just below the base of the brain. DI caused by a lack of ADH is called central diabetes insipidus . When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus . Nephrogenic means related to the kidney. Central DI is rare. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland as a result of: Genetic problems Head injury (common cause) Infection in the brain Problem with the ADH-producing cells due to an autoimmune disease Loss of blood supply to the pituitary gland Surgery in the area of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (most common cause) Tumors in or near the pituitary gland Nephrogenic DI involves a defect in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys do not respond to ADH. Nephrogenic DI is very rare. Nephrogenic DI may be caused by: Certain medicines, such as lithium Genetic problems High level of calcium in the body ( hypercalcemia ) Kidney disease, such as polycystic kidney disease","Symptoms of DI include: Excessive thirst that may be intense or uncontrollable, usually with the need to drink large amounts of water or craving for ice water Excessive urine volume Excessive urination, often needing to urinate every hour throughout the day and night Very dilute, pale urine",,

Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome,Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a complication of type 2 diabetes. It involves an extremely high blood sugar (glucose) level without the presence of ketones.,"HHS is a condition of: Extremely high blood sugar level Extreme lack of water ( dehydration ) Decreased alertness or consciousness (in many cases) A buildup of ketones in the body (ketoacidosis) may also occur, but it is unusual and is often mild compared with diabetic ketoacidosis . HHS is more often seen in people with type 2 diabetes who don't have their diabetes under control. It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes. The condition may be brought on by: Infection Other illness, such as heart attack or stroke Medicines that decrease the effect of insulin in the body Medicines or conditions that increase fluid loss Running out of, or not taking prescribed diabetes medicines Normally, the kidneys try to make up for a high glucose level in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. But this also causes the body to lose water. If you do not drink enough water, or you drink fluids that contain sugar and keep eating foods with carbohydrates, you become very dehydrated. When this occurs, the kidneys are no longer able to get rid of the extra glucose. As a result, the glucose level in your blood can become very high, sometimes more than 10 times the normal amount. The loss of water also makes the blood more concentrated than normal. This is called hyperosmolarity. It is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances. This draws the water out of the body's other organs, including the brain. Risk factors include: A stressful event such as infection, heart attack , stroke , or recent surgery Heart failure Impaired thirst Limited access to water (especially in people with dementia or who are bedbound) Older age Poor kidney function Poor management of diabetes, not following the treatment plan as directed Stopping or running out of insulin or other medicines that lower glucose level","Symptoms may include any of the following: Increased thirst and urination (at the beginning of the syndrome) Feeling weak Nausea Weight loss Dry mouth, dry tongue Fever Seizures Confusion Coma Symptoms may get worse over days or weeks. Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Loss of feeling or function of muscles Problems with movement Speech impairment",,HHS; Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma; Nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma (NKHHC); Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (HONK); Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non-ketotic state; Diabetes - hyperosmolar
Diabetic ketoacidosis,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when the body starts breaking down fat at a rate that is much too fast. The liver processes the fat into a fuel called ketones, which causes the blood to become acidic.","DKA happens when the signal from insulin in the body is so low that: Blood sugar (glucose) can't go into cells to be used as a fuel source. The liver makes a large amount of glucose. Fat is broken down too rapidly for the body to process. The fat is broken down by the liver into a fuel called ketones. Ketones are normally produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat after it has been a long time since your last meal. These ketones are normally used by the muscles and the heart. When ketones are produced too quickly and build up in the blood, they can be toxic by making the blood acidic. This condition is known as ketoacidosis. DKA is sometimes the first sign of type 1 diabetes in people who have not yet been diagnosed. It can also occur in someone who has already been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Infection, injury, a serious illness, missing doses of insulin shots, or the stress of surgery can lead to DKA in people with type 1 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA, but it is much less common and less severe. It is usually triggered by prolonged uncontrolled blood sugar, missing doses of medicines, or a severe illness or infection.","Common symptoms of DKA can include: Decreased alertness Deep, rapid breathing Dehydration Dry skin and mouth Flushed face Frequent urination or thirst that lasts for a day or more Fruity-smelling breath Headache Muscle stiffness or aches Nausea and vomiting Stomach pain",,DKA; Ketoacidosis; Diabetes - ketoacidosis

Diaper rash,Diaper rash is a skin problem that develops in the area under an infant's diaper.,"Diaper rashes are common in babies from 4 to 15 months old. They may be noticed more when babies begin to eat solid foods. Diaper rashes caused by infection with a yeast (fungus) called candida are very common in children. Candida grows best in warm, moist places, such as under a diaper. Candida diaper rash is more likely to occur in babies who: Are not kept clean and dry Are taking antibiotics or whose mothers are taking antibiotics while breastfeeding Have more frequent stools Other causes of diaper rash include: Acids in the stool (seen more often when the child has diarrhea) Ammonia (a chemical produced when bacteria break down urine) Diapers that are too tight or rub the skin Reactions to soaps and other products used to clean cloth diapers","You may notice the following in your child's diaper area: Bright red rash that gets bigger Very red and scaly areas on the scrotum and penis in boys Red or scaly areas on the labia and vagina in girls Pimples, blisters, ulcers, large bumps, or sores filled with pus Smaller red patches (called satellite lesions) that grow and blend in with the other patches Older infants may scratch when the diaper is removed.

Diaphragmatic hernia,A diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect in which there is an abnormal opening in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle between the chest and abdomen that helps you breathe. The abnormal opening allows part of the organs from the belly to move into the chest cavity near the lungs.,"A diaphragmatic hernia is a rare defect. It occurs while the baby is developing in the womb. The diaphragm is not fully developed. Due to this, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney may take up part of the chest cavity. CDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either. It is not clear if the diaphragmatic hernia causes the underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels, or the other way around. Forty percent of babies with this condition have other problems as well. Having a parent or sibling with the condition increases the risk.",Severe breathing problems usually develop shortly after the baby is born. This is due in part to poor movement of the diaphragm muscle and crowding of the lung tissue. Problems with breathing and oxygen levels are often due to underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels as well. Other symptoms include: Bluish colored skin due to lack of oxygen Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Fast heart rate (tachycardia),,Hernia - diaphragmatic; Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (CDH)
Diarrhea,Diarrhea is when you pass loose or watery stool.,"The most common cause of diarrhea is the stomach flu ( viral gastroenteritis ). This mild viral infection most often goes away on its own within a few days. Eating or drinking food or water that contains certain types of bacteria or parasites can also lead to diarrhea. This problem may be called food poisoning . Certain medicines may also cause diarrhea , including: Some antibiotics Chemotherapy drugs for cancer Laxatives containing magnesium Diarrhea may also be caused by medical disorders, such as: Celiac disease Inflammatory bowel diseases ( Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis ) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Lactose intolerance (which causes problems after drinking milk and eating other dairy products) Malabsorption syndromes Less common causes of diarrhea include: Carcinoid syndrome Disorders of the nerves that supply the intestines Removal of part of the stomach ( gastrectomy ) or small intestine Radiation therapy People who travel to developing countries can get diarrhea from unclean water or food that has not been handled safely.

Diastasis recti,Diastasis recti is a separation between the left and right side of the rectus abdominis muscle. This muscle covers the front surface of the belly area.,Diastasis recti is common in newborns. It is seen most often in premature and African American infants. Pregnant women may develop the condition because of increased tension on the abdominal wall. The risk is higher with multiple births or many pregnancies.,"A diastasis recti looks like a ridge, which runs down the middle of the belly area. It stretches from the bottom of the breastbone to the belly button. It increases with muscle straining. In infants, the condition is most easily seen when the baby tries to sit up. When the infant is relaxed, you can often feel the edges of the rectus muscles. Diastasis recti is commonly seen in women who have multiple pregnancies. This is because the muscles have been stretched many times. Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy. In the later part of pregnancy, the top of the pregnant uterus can be seen bulging out of the abdominal wall. An outline of parts of the unborn baby may be seen in some severe cases.",,

Differences of sex development,"Differences of sex development (DSD) is a group of conditions in which there is a discrepancy between the external (outside) genitals (penis, scrotum, vulva, labia) and the internal (inside) genitals (testes, vagina, ovaries). Intersex is an older term for DSD.","There are many causes of DSD. They can be divided into several categories, discussed in more detail below: 46,XX DSD 46,XY DSD Ovotesticular DSD Complex or undetermined DSD Note: The cause of DSD may remain undetermined, even with modern diagnostic techniques. 46,XX DSD The person has the XX chromosomes (typically seen in females), the ovaries of a female, but external genitals that appear male. This most often is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia (""lips"" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse (grow together), and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46,XX with virilization. There are several possible causes: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This is the most common cause of 46,XX DSD. Male hormones (such as testosterone) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy. Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother. These are most often ovarian tumors. Mothers who have children with 46,XX DSD should be checked for this unless there is another clear cause. Aromatase deficiency. This may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little can lead to 46,XX DSD. At puberty, these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics. 46,XY DSD The person has the XY chromosomes (typically seen in males), but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous ( ambiguous genitalia ), or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46,XY with undervirilization. Formation of normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones. Therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46,XY DSD has many possible causes: Problems with the testes. The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis . Problems with testosterone formation. Testosterone is made through a series of chemical steps. Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46,XY DSD. Different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can also fall in this category. Problems with using testosterone. Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY DSD due to conditions such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least 5 different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty. AIS is the most common cause of 46,XY DSD. In this situation, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. Over 150 different defects have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS. OVOTESTICULAR DSD The person has both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. In most people with ovotesticular DSD, the underlying cause is unknown. COMPLEX OR UNDETERMINED DSD Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46,XX or 46,XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45,XO (only one X chromosome), and 47,XXY or 47,XXX - both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in a condition in which there is a discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels and overall sexual development, due to the altered numbers of sex chromosomes.","The symptoms associated with intersex will depend on the underlying cause. They may include: Ambiguous genitalia at birth A very small penis (micropenis) Enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly) Partly fused labia Undescended testes (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys Labial or groin (inguinal) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls The opening of the penis is somewhere other than at the tip ( hypospadias ); in females, the urethra (urine canal) opens into the vagina Otherwise unusual-appearing genitalia at birth Electrolyte abnormalities Delayed or absent puberty Unexpected changes at puberty",,DSD; Intersex; Disorders of sex development; DSDs; Pseudohermaphroditism; Hermaphroditism; Hermaphrodite

Digitalis toxicity,Digitalis is a medicine that is used to treat certain heart conditions. Digitalis toxicity can be a side effect of digitalis therapy. It may occur when you take too much of the drug at one time. It can also occur when levels of the drug build up for other reasons such as other medical problems you have.,"Digitalis toxicity can be caused by high levels of digitalis in the body. A lower tolerance to the drug can also cause digitalis toxicity. People with lower tolerance may have a normal level of digitalis in their blood and still have adverse effects. People may also develop digitalis toxicity if they have other risk factors. People with heart failure who take digoxin are commonly given medicines called diuretics. These drugs remove excess fluid from the body. Many diuretics can cause potassium loss. A low level of potassium in the body can increase the risk of digitalis toxicity. Digitalis toxicity may also develop in people who take digoxin and have a low level of magnesium in their body. You are more likely to have this condition if you take digoxin, digitoxin, or other digitalis medicines along with drugs that interact with it. Some of these drugs are quinidine, flecainide, verapamil, and amiodarone. If your kidneys do not work well, digitalis can build up in your body. Normally, it is removed through the urine. Any problem that affects how your kidneys work (including dehydration ) makes digitalis toxicity more likely. Some plants contain chemicals that can cause symptoms similar to digitalis toxicity if they are eaten. These include foxglove, oleander, and lily of the valley.","These are symptoms of digitalis toxicity: Confusion Irregular pulse Loss of appetite Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea Fast heartbeat Vision changes (unusual), including blind spots, blurred vision, changes in how colors look, or seeing spots Other symptoms may include: Decreased consciousness Decreased urine output Difficulty breathing when lying down Excessive nighttime urination Overall swelling",,

Diphtheria,Diphtheria is an acute infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.,"The bacteria that cause diphtheria spread through respiratory droplets (such as from a cough or sneeze) of an infected person or someone who carries the bacteria but has no symptoms. The bacteria most commonly infect your nose and throat. The throat infection causes a gray to black, tough, fiber-like covering, which can block your airways. In some cases, diphtheria infects your skin first and causes skin lesions . Once you are infected, the bacteria make dangerous substances called toxins. The toxins spread through your bloodstream to other organs, such as the heart and brain, and cause damage. Because of widespread vaccination (immunization) of children, diphtheria is now rare in many parts of the world. Risk factors for diphtheria include crowded environments, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization.","Symptoms usually occur 2 to 5 days after the bacteria enter your body: Fever and chills Sore throat, hoarseness Painful swallowing Croup-like (barking) cough Drooling (suggests airway blockage is about to occur) Bluish coloration of the skin Bloody, watery drainage from nose Breathing problems, including difficulty breathing, fast breathing, high-pitched breathing sound ( stridor ) Skin sores (usually seen in tropical areas) Sometimes there are no symptoms.",,Respiratory diphtheria; Pharyngeal diphtheria; Diphtheric cardiomyopathy; Diphtheric polyneuropathy

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive.,"When you are injured, proteins in the blood that form blood clots travel to the injury site to help stop bleeding. If these proteins become abnormally active throughout the body, you could develop DIC. The underlying cause is usually due to inflammation, infection, or cancer. In some cases of DIC, small blood clots form in the blood vessels. Some of these clots can clog the vessels and cut off the normal blood supply to organs such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. Lack of blood flow can damage and cause major injury to the organs. In other cases of DIC, the clotting proteins in your blood are consumed. When this happens, you may have a high risk of serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. You may also have bleeding that starts spontaneously (on its own). The disease can also cause your healthy red blood cells to fragment and break up when they travel through the small vessels that are filled with clots. Risk factors for DIC include: Blood transfusion reaction Cancer, especially certain types of leukemia Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Infection in the blood, especially by bacteria or fungus Liver disease Pregnancy complications (such as placenta tissue that is left behind after delivery) Recent surgery or anesthesia Severe tissue injury (as in burns and head injury) Large hemangioma (a blood vessel that is not formed properly)","Symptoms of DIC may include any of the following: Bleeding, from many sites in the body Blood clots Bruising Drop in blood pressure Shortness of breath Confusion, memory loss or change of behavior Fever",,Consumption coagulopathy; DIC
Disseminated tuberculosis,Disseminated tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection in which mycobacteria spread from the lungs to other parts of the body through the blood or lymph system.,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection can develop after breathing in droplets sprayed into the air from a cough or sneeze by someone infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The resulting lung infection is called primary TB. The usual site of TB is the lungs ( pulmonary TB ), but other organs can be involved. In the United States, most people with primary TB get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in a small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection. Disseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it occurs years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weakened immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medicines. Infants and older adults are also at higher risk. Your risk of catching TB increases if you: Are around people who have the disease (such as during overseas travel) Live in crowded or unclean conditions Are immunocompromised by a disease or medicines Have poor nutrition The following factors can increase the rate of TB infection in a population: Increase in HIV infections Increase in number of homeless people with unstable housing (poor environment and nutrition) The appearance of drug-resistant strains of TB","Disseminated tuberculosis can affect many different body areas.

Distal median nerve dysfunction,Distal median nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy that affects the movement of or sensation in the hands.,"Dysfunction of one nerve group, such as the distal median nerve, is called a mononeuropathy . Mononeuropathy usually means there is a local cause of the nerve damage. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage. This condition occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. The most common reason is trapping (entrapment) by a ligament in the wrist. This causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Trapping puts pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly. Or, it may increase the risk for trapping the nerve later on. Inflammation of the tendons ( tendinitis ) or joints ( arthritis ) can also put pressure on the nerve. Some repetitive movements increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment. Women are more affected than men. Problems that affect the tissue near the nerve or cause deposits to form in the tissue can block blood flow and lead to pressure on the nerve. Such conditions include: Too much growth hormone in the body ( acromegaly ) Diabetes Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) Kidney disease A blood cancer called multiple myeloma Pregnancy Obesity Amyloidosis In some cases, no cause can be found. Diabetes can make this condition worse.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Pain in the wrist or hand that may be severe and wake you up at night, and that may be felt in other areas, such as the upper arm (this is called referred pain) Sensation changes in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers, such as a burning feeling, decreased sensation, numbness and tingling Weakness of the hand that causes you to drop things or have difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt",,Neuropathy - distal median nerve
Distal renal tubular acidosis,"Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis).","When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood becomes too acidic. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells. The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Distal renal tubular acidosis (type I RTA) is caused by a defect in the kidney tubes that causes acid to build up in the blood. Type I RTA is caused by a variety of conditions, including: Amyloidosis , a buildup of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in the tissues and organs Fabry disease, an abnormal buildup in the body of a certain type of fatty substance High level of calcium in the blood Sickle cell disease , red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shape Sjögren syndrome , an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed Systemic lupus erythematosus , an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue Wilson disease , an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues Use of certain medicines, such as amphotericin B, lithium, and analgesics","Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following: Confusion or decreased alertness Fatigue Impaired growth in children Increased breathing rate Kidney stones Nephrocalcinosis (too much calcium deposited in the kidneys) Osteomalacia (softening of the bones) Muscle weakness Other symptoms may include: Bone pain Decreased urine output Increased heart rate or irregular heartbeat Muscle cramps Pain in the back, flank, or abdomen Skeletal abnormalities",,Renal tubular acidosis - distal; Renal tubular acidosis type I; Type I RTA; RTA - distal; Classical RTA

Diverticulitis,"Diverticula are small, bulging sacs or pouches that form on the inner wall of the intestine. Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected. Most often, these pouches are in the lower part of the large intestine (colon).","The formation of pouches or sacs on the intestinal lining is called diverticulosis. It is found in more than half of Americans over age 60. However, no one knows exactly what causes the pouches to form. Eating a low-fiber diet mostly made up of processed foods may be a cause. Constipation and hard stools are more likely when you do not eat enough fiber. Straining to pass stools increases the pressure in the colon or intestines, which may lead to the formation of these pouches. In some cases, one of the pouches can become inflamed and a small tear develops in the lining of the intestine. This can lead to an infection at the site. When this occurs, the condition is called diverticulitis. The cause of diverticulitis is not known.","People with diverticulosis often have no symptoms, but they may have bloating and cramping in the lower part of the belly. Rarely, they may notice blood in their stool or on toilet paper. Symptoms of diverticulitis are more severe and often start suddenly, but they may become worse over a few days. They include: Pain or discomfort, usually in the left lower part of the abdomen Bloating or gas Fever and chills Nausea and vomiting Not feeling hungry and not eating",,
Diverticulosis,"Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging sacs or pouches form on the inner wall of the intestine. These sacs are called diverticula.

About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80. No one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form. For many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall. However, whether a low-fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven. Other possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity. Eating nuts, popcorn, or corn does not appear to lead to inflammation of these pouches ( diverticulitis ).","Most people with diverticulosis have no symptoms.

Dizziness,Dizziness is a term that is often used to describe 2 different symptoms: lightheadedness and vertigo.,"Lightheadedness occurs when your brain does not get enough blood. This may occur if: You have a sudden drop in blood pressure. Your body does not have enough water (is dehydrated) because of vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or other conditions. You get up too quickly after sitting or lying down (this is more common in older people). Lightheadedness may also occur if you have the flu , low blood sugar , a cold, allergies, or take medicines that may lower your blood pressure. More serious conditions that can lead to lightheadedness include: Heart problems, such as a heart attack or abnormal heart beat Stroke Bleeding inside the body Shock (extreme drop in blood pressure) If any of these serious disorders are present, you will usually also have symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms. Vertigo may be due to: Benign positional vertigo , a spinning feeling that occurs when you move your head Labyrinthitis , a viral infection of the inner ear that usually follows a cold or flu Meniere disease , a common inner ear problem Other causes of lightheadedness or vertigo may include: Use of certain medicines Stroke Multiple sclerosis Seizures Brain tumor Bleeding in the brain",,"If you tend to get lightheaded when you stand up: Avoid sudden changes in posture. Get up from a lying position slowly, and stay seated for a few moments before standing. When standing, make sure you have something to hold on to. If you have vertigo, the following tips can help prevent your symptoms from becoming worse: Keep still and rest when symptoms occur. Avoid sudden movements or position changes. Slowly increase activity. You may need a cane or other help walking when you have a loss of balance during a vertigo attack. Avoid bright lights, TV, and reading during vertigo attacks because they may make symptoms worse. Avoid activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing until 1 week after your symptoms disappear.

Double aortic arch,"Double aortic arch is an abnormal formation of the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It is a congenital problem, which means that it is present at birth.","Double aortic arch is a common form of a group of defects that affect the development of the aorta in the womb. These defects cause an abnormal formation called a vascular ring (a circle of blood vessels). Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). As babies develop in the womb, the arches split into several parts. The body breaks down some of the arches, while others form into arteries. A normally developed aorta is a single arch that leaves the heart and moves leftward. In double aortic arch, some of the arches that should have disappeared are still present at birth in addition to the normal arch. Babies with a double aortic arch have an aorta that is made up of two vessels instead of one. The two parts to the aorta have smaller arteries branching off of them. As a result, the two branches go around and press down on the windpipe and the tube (esophagus) that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. A double aortic arch may occur in other congenital heart defects, including: Tetralogy of Fallot Truncus arteriosus Transposition of the great arteries Ventricular septal defect Double aortic arch is very rare. Vascular rings make up a small percentage of all congenital heart problems. Of these, a little more than half are caused by double aortic arch. The condition occurs equally in males and females. It is often present in people with certain chromosome abnormalities.","Because symptoms of double aortic arch are often mild, the problem may not be discovered until the child is a few years old. The double aortic arch may press on the trachea and esophagus, leading to trouble breathing and swallowing. The severity of the symptoms depends on how much the aortic arch is pressing on these structures. Breathing symptoms include: High-pitched sound during breathing (stridor) Noisy breathing Repeated pneumonias Wheezing Digestive symptoms may include: Choking Difficulty eating and swallowing Vomiting",,Aortic arch anomaly; Double arch; Congenital heart defect - double aortic arch; Birth defect heart - double aortic arch
Double inlet left ventricle,Double inlet left ventricle (DILV) is a heart defect that is present from birth (congenital). It affects the valves and chambers of the heart. Babies born with this condition have only one working pumping chamber (ventricle) in their heart.,"DILV is one of several heart defects known as single (or common) ventricle defects. People with DILV have a large left ventricle and a small right ventricle. The left ventricle is the pumping chamber of the heart that sends oxygen-rich blood to the body. The right ventricle is the pumping chamber that sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs. In the normal heart, the right and left ventricles receive blood from the right and left atria. The atria are upper chambers of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flows to the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps blood to the pulmonary artery. This is the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Blood with fresh oxygen returns to the left atrium and left ventricle. The aorta then carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body from the left ventricle. The aorta is the major artery leading out of the heart. In people with DILV, only the left ventricle is developed. Both atria empty blood into this ventricle. This means that oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. The mixture is then pumped to both the body and the lungs. DILV can happen if the large blood vessels arising from the heart are in the wrong positions. The aorta arises from the small right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. It can also occur when the arteries are in normal positions and arise from the usual ventricles. In this case, blood flows from the left to right ventricle through a hole between the chambers called a ventricular septal defect (VSD). DILV is very rare. The exact cause is unknown. The problem most likely occurs early in the pregnancy, when the baby's heart develops. People with DILV often also have other heart problems, such as: Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta) Pulmonary atresia (pulmonary valve of the heart is not formed properly) Pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve)",Symptoms of DILV may include: Bluish color to the skin and lips ( cyanosis ) due to low oxygen in the blood Failure to gain weight and grow Pale skin (pallor) Poor feeding from becoming tired easily Sweating Swollen legs or abdomen Trouble breathing,,DILV; Single ventricle; Common ventricle; Univentricular heart; Univentricular heart of the left ventricular type; Congenital heart defect - DILV; Cyanotic heart defect - DILV; Birth defect - DILV
Double outlet right ventricle,"Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a heart disease that is present from birth (congenital). The aorta connects to the right ventricle (RV, the chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs), instead of to the left ventricle (LV, the chamber that normally pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body).","In a normal heart structure, the aorta connects to the LV. The pulmonary artery normally is connected to the RV. In DORV, both arteries flow out of the RV. This is a problem because the RV pumps oxygen-poor blood. This blood is then circulated throughout the body. Another defect called a ventricular septal defect (VSD) always occurs with DORV. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs flows from the left side of the heart, through the VSD opening and into the RV. This helps the infant with DORV by allowing oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Even with this mixture, the body may not get enough oxygen. This makes the heart work harder to meet the body's needs. There are several types of DORV. The difference between these types is the location of the VSD as it relates to the location of the pulmonary artery and aorta. The symptoms and severity of the problem will depend on the type of DORV. The presence of pulmonary valve stenosis also affects the condition. People with DORV often have other heart defects, such as: Endocardial cushion defects (the walls separating all four chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent) Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the aorta) Mitral valve problems Pulmonary atresia (pulmonary valve does not form properly) Pulmonary valve stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve) Right-sided aortic arch (aortic arch is on right instead of the left) Transposition of the great arteries (the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched)",Signs of DORV may include: Enlarged heart Heart murmur Rapid breathing Rapid heartbeat Symptoms of DORV may include: Poor feeding from becoming tired easily Bluish color of the skin and lips (cyanosis) Clubbing (thickening of the nail beds) of toes and fingers (late sign) Failure to gain weight and grow Pale coloring (pallor) Sweating Swollen legs or abdomen Trouble breathing,,DORV; Taussig-Bing anomaly; DORV with doubly-committed VSD; DORV with noncommitted VSD; DORV with subaortic VSD; Congenital heart defect - DORV; Cyanotic heart defect - DORV; Birth defect - DORV
Down syndrome,Down syndrome is a genetic condition in which a person has 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46.,"In most cases, Down syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This form of Down syndrome is called trisomy 21. The extra chromosome causes problems with the way the body and brain develop. Down syndrome is one of the most common causes of birth defects.","Down syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. No matter how severe the condition is, people with Down syndrome have a widely-recognized appearance. The head may be smaller than normal and abnormally shaped. For example, the head may be round with a flat area on the back. The inner corner of the eyes may be rounded instead of pointed. Common physical signs include: Decreased muscle tone at birth Excess skin at the nape of the neck Flattened nose Separated joints between the bones of the skull (sutures) Single crease in the palm of the hand Small ears Small mouth Upward slanting eyes Wide, short hands with short fingers White spots on the colored part of the eye (Brushfield spots) Physical development is often slower than normal. Most children with Down syndrome never reach average adult height. Children may also have delayed mental and social development. Common problems may include: Impulsive behavior Poor judgment Short attention span Slow learning As children with Down syndrome grow and become aware of their limitations, they may also feel frustration and anger. Many different medical conditions are seen in people with Down syndrome, including: Birth defects involving the heart, such as an atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect Dementia Eye problems, such as cataracts (most children with Down syndrome need glasses) Early and massive vomiting, which may be a sign of a gastrointestinal blockage, such as esophageal atresia and duodenal atresia Hearing problems, probably caused by repeated ear infections Hip problems and risk of hip dislocation Long-term (chronic) constipation problems Sleep apnea (because the mouth, throat, and airway are narrowed in children with Down syndrome) Teeth that appear later than normal and in a location that may cause problems with chewing Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism )",,Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome

Do not drive when drowsy.",Sleepiness - during the day; Hypersomnia; Somnolence
Drug allergies,Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine).,"A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. The reaction of the body when a drug allergy is present generally involves special cells called B and T cell lymphocytes. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (mainly insulin from animal sources) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction caused by the formation of IgE antibodies. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy.","Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Drug allergies can also be associated with low blood counts. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations )",,Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity
Drug use first aid,"Drug use is the misuse or overuse of any medicine or drug, including alcohol. This article discusses first aid for drug overdose and withdrawal.","An overdose of narcotics can cause sleepiness, slowed breathing, and even unconsciousness . When prescription medicines are taken in higher than prescribed amounts, serious side effects may occur. Uppers ( stimulants ) produce excitement, increased heart rate, and rapid breathing . Downers (depressants) do the opposite. Mind-altering drugs are called hallucinogens. They vary widely in effect and include drugs like peyote and LSD , which primarily affect serotonin receptors in the brain, as well as ketamine and PCP (angel dust), which affect multiple receptors in the brain. These mind-altering substances are not well understood and in some cases may cause paranoia , dangerous behaviors, or extreme social withdrawal. Cannabis drugs such as marijuana may cause relaxation, impaired motor skills, and increased appetite.","Drug overdose symptoms vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include: Abnormal pupil size or pupils that don't change size when light is shined into them Agitation Seizures , tremors Delusional or paranoid behavior, hallucinations Difficulty breathing Drowsiness, coma Nausea and vomiting Staggering or unsteady gait ( ataxia ) Sweating or extremely dry, hot skin, blisters, rash Violent or aggressive behavior Death Drug withdrawal symptoms also vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include: Abdominal cramping Agitation, restlessness Cold sweat Delusions, hallucinations Depression Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Seizures Death",,Overdose from drugs; Drug abuse first aid
Drug-induced diarrhea,"Drug-induced diarrhea is loose, watery stools that occur when you take certain medicines.","Nearly all medicines may cause diarrhea as a side effect. The medicines listed below, however, are more likely to cause diarrhea. Laxatives are meant to cause diarrhea. They work either by drawing water into the gut or by causing the muscles of the intestines to contract. However, taking too much of a laxative can cause diarrhea that is a problem. Antacids that have magnesium in them may also cause diarrhea or make it worse. Antibiotics also can produce diarrhea. Normally, the intestines have many different bacteria. They keep each other in balance. Antibiotics destroy some of these bacteria, which allow other types to grow too much. In some cases, antibiotics can allow a type of bacteria called Clostridioides difficile to grow too much. This can lead to severe, watery, and often bloody diarrhea due to a condition called pseudomembranous colitis. Many other drugs may cause diarrhea: Chemotherapy medicines used to treat cancer. Drugs used to treat heartburn and stomach ulcers, such as omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlanxoprazole (Dexilant), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Zantac 360 and Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid). This is uncommon. Medicines that suppress the immune system (such as mycophenolate). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat pain and arthritis, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Metformin used to treat diabetes. Some herbal teas contain senna or other ""natural"" laxatives that can cause diarrhea. Other vitamins, minerals, or supplements may also cause diarrhea.",,,Diarrhea associated with medicines; Medicine-induced diarrhea
Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia,"Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia is a blood disorder that occurs when a medicine triggers the body's defense (immune) system to attack its own red blood cells. This causes red blood cells to break down earlier than normal, a process called hemolysis.","Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Normally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal. In some cases, a drug can cause the immune system to mistake your own red blood cells for foreign substances. The body responds by making antibodies to attack the body's own red blood cells. The antibodies attach to red blood cells and cause them to break down too early. Drugs that can cause this type of hemolytic anemia include: Cephalosporins (a class of antibiotics), most common cause Dapsone Levodopa Levofloxacin Methyldopa Nitrofurantoin Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Penicillin and its derivatives Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) Quinidine Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is rare in children.",Symptoms may include any of the following: Dark urine Fatigue Pale skin color Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Yellow skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ),,Immune hemolytic anemia secondary to drugs; Anemia - immune hemolytic - secondary to drugs
Drug-induced liver injury,Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an injury of the liver that may occur when you take certain medicines.,"The liver helps the body break down certain medicines. These include some drugs that you buy over-the-counter or your health care provider prescribes for you. However, the process is slower in some people. This can make you more likely to get liver damage. Some drugs can cause hepatitis with small doses, even if the liver breakdown system is normal. Large doses of many medicines can damage a normal liver. Many different drugs can cause drug-induced hepatitis. Painkillers and fever reducers that contain acetaminophen are a common cause of liver injury, particularly when taken in doses greater than those recommended. People who drink alcohol to excess are more likely to have this problem. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, may also cause drug-induced hepatitis. Other drugs that can lead to liver injury include: Amiodarone Anabolic steroids Birth control pills Chlorpromazine Erythromycin Halothane (a type of anesthesia) Methyldopa Isoniazid Methotrexate Statins Sulfa drugs Tetracyclines Amoxicillin-clavulanate Some anti-seizure medicines Disulfiram Niacin Azathoaprine Ketoconazole",Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Dark urine Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Headache Jaundice Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Rash White or clay-colored stools,,Toxic hepatitis; Drug-induced hepatitis; DILI
Drug-induced low blood sugar,Drug-induced low blood sugar is low blood glucose that results from taking medicine.,"Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is common in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or other medicines to control their diabetes. Other than certain medicines, the following can also cause blood sugar (glucose) level to drop: Drinking alcohol Getting more activity than usual Intentionally or unintentionally overdosing on the medicines used to treat diabetes Missing meals Even when diabetes is managed very carefully, the medicines used to treat diabetes can result in drug-induced low blood sugar. The condition may also occur when someone without diabetes takes a medicine used to treat diabetes. In rare cases, non-diabetes-related medicines can cause low blood sugar. Medicines that can cause drug-induced low blood sugar include: Beta-blockers (such as atenolol, or propranolol overdose) Cibenzoline and quinidine (heart arrhythmia drugs) Glinides (such as nateglinide and repaglinide) Indomethacin (a pain reliever) Insulin Metformin when used with sulfonylureas SGLT2 inhibitors (such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin) with or without sulfonylureas Sulfonylureas (such as glipizide, glimepiride, glyburide) Thiazolidinediones (such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) when used with sulfonylureas Drugs that fight infections (such as gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, pentamidine, quinine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)",,,Hypoglycemia - drug-induced; Low blood glucose - drug-induced

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia,Thrombocytopenia is any disorder in which there are not enough platelets. Platelets are elements in the blood that help the blood clot. A low platelet count makes bleeding more likely.,"Drug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs when certain medicines destroy platelets or interfere with the body's ability to make enough of them. There are two types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: immune and nonimmune. If a medicine causes your immune system to produce antibodies which seek and destroy your platelets, the condition is called drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Heparin, a blood thinner, is the most common cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. If a medicine prevents your bone marrow from making enough platelets, the condition is called drug-induced nonimmune thrombocytopenia. Chemotherapy drugs and a seizure medicine called valproic acid may lead to this problem. Other medicines that cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia include: Furosemide Gold, used to treat arthritis Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Penicillin Quinidine Quinine Ranitidine Sulfonamides Linezolid and other antibiotics Statins",Decreased platelets may cause: Abnormal bleeding Bleeding when you brush your teeth Easy bruising Pinpoint red spots on the skin ( petechiae ),,Drug-induced thrombocytopenia; Immune thrombocytopenia - drug

Dubin-Johnson syndrome,"Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS) is a disorder passed down through families (inherited). In this condition, you may have mild jaundice throughout life.","DJS is a very rare genetic disorder. In order to inherit the condition, a child must get a copy of the variant gene from both parents. The syndrome interferes with the body's ability to move bilirubin through the liver into the bile. When the liver and spleen break down worn out red blood cells, bilirubin is produced. Bilirubin normally moves into the bile, which is produced by the liver. It then flows into the bile ducts, is stored in the gallbladder, and then flows into the digestive system. When bilirubin is not properly transported into the bile, it builds up in the bloodstream. This causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice. Severely high levels of bilirubin can damage the brain and other organs. People with DJS have lifelong mild jaundice that may be made worse by: Alcohol Birth control pills Environmental factors that affect the liver Infection Pregnancy Fasting or dehydration Fatigue","Mild jaundice, which may not appear until puberty or adulthood, is most often the only symptom of DJS.",,
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder. It involves muscle weakness, which quickly gets worse.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy . It worsens quickly. Other muscular dystrophies (including Becker muscular dystrophy ) get worse much more slowly. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition. The condition most often affects boys due to the way the disease is inherited. The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","Symptoms most often appear before age 6. They may start as early as infancy. Most boys show no symptoms in the first few years of life. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Learning difficulties (the IQ can be below 75). Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time). Muscle weakness: Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body. Problems with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping). Frequent falls. Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs. Shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the feet due to a weakening of the heart muscle. Problem breathing due to a weakening of the respiratory muscles. Gradual worsening of muscle weakness. Progressive difficulty walking : Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair. Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20.",,Pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy; Muscular dystrophy - Duchenne type
Duodenal atresia,Duodenal atresia is a condition in which the first part of the small bowel (the duodenum) has not developed properly. It is not open and does not allow the passage of stomach contents.,"The cause of duodenal atresia is not known. It is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would. Many infants with duodenal atresia also have Down syndrome . Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects.","Symptoms of duodenal atresia include: Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes) Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing bile ) Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours No bowel movements after first few meconium stools",,

E coli enteritis,E coli enteritis is swelling (inflammation) of the small intestine from Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria. It is the most common cause of travelers' diarrhea.,"E coli is a type of bacteria that lives in the intestines of humans and animals. Most of the time, it does not cause any problems. However, certain types (or strains) of E coli can cause food poisoning. One strain ( E coli O157:H7) can cause a severe case of food poisoning. Bacteria may get into your food in different ways: Meat or poultry may come into contact with normal bacteria from the intestines of an animal while it is being processed. Water used during growing or shipping may contain animal or human waste. Food may be handled in an unsafe way during transport or storage. Unsafe food handling or preparation may occur in grocery stores, restaurants, or homes. Food poisoning can occur after eating or drinking: Food prepared by a person who did not wash hands well Food prepared using unclean cooking utensils, cutting boards, or other tools Dairy products or food containing mayonnaise (such as coleslaw or potato salad) that have been out of the refrigerator too long Frozen or refrigerated foods that are not stored at the proper temperature or are not properly reheated Fish or oysters Raw fruits or vegetables that have not been washed well Raw vegetable or fruit juices and dairy products Undercooked meats or eggs Water from a well or stream, or city or town water that has not been treated Although not common, E coli can be spread from one person to another. This may happen when someone does not wash their hands after a bowel movement and then touches other objects or someone else's hands.","Symptoms occur when E coli bacteria enter the intestine. Most of the time symptoms develop 24 to 72 hours after being infected. The most common symptom is sudden, severe diarrhea that is often bloody.

Ear - blocked at high altitudes,The air pressure outside of your body changes as altitude changes. This creates a difference in pressure on the two sides of the eardrum. You may feel pressure and blockage in the ears as a result.,,,,High altitudes and blocked ears; Flying and blocked ears; Eustachian tube dysfunction - high altitude
Ear barotrauma,Ear barotrauma causes discomfort in the ear due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. It may include damage to the ear.,"The air pressure in the middle ear is most often the same as the air pressure outside of the body. The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear and the back of the nose and upper throat. Swallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the air pressure in the middle ear is different than the pressure on the outside of the eardrum. This can cause barotrauma. Many people have barotrauma at some time. The problem often occurs with altitude changes, such as flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains. If you have a congested nose from allergies, colds, or an upper respiratory infection, you are more likely to develop barotrauma. Blockage of the eustachian tube could also be present before birth (congenital). It may also be caused by swelling in the throat.","Common symptoms include: Dizziness Ear discomfort or pain in one or both ears Hearing loss (slight) Sensation of fullness or stuffiness in the ears Other symptoms may develop if the condition is very bad or goes on for a long time, such as: Ear pain Feeling of pressure in the ears (as if underwater) Moderate to severe hearing loss Nosebleed",,Barotitis media; Barotrauma; Ear popping - barotrauma; Pressure-related ear pain; Eustachian tube dysfunction - barotrauma; Barotitis; Ear squeeze
Ear discharge,"Ear discharge is drainage of blood, ear wax, pus, or fluid from the ear.","Most of the time, any fluid leaking out of an ear is ear wax. A ruptured eardrum can cause a white, slightly bloody, or yellow discharge from the ear. Dry crusted material on a child's pillow is often a sign of a ruptured eardrum. The eardrum may also bleed. Causes of a ruptured eardrum include: Foreign object in the ear canal Injury from a blow to the head, foreign object, very loud noises, or sudden pressure changes (such as in airplanes) Inserting cotton-tipped swabs or other small objects into the ear Middle ear infection Other causes of ear discharge include: Eczema and other skin irritations in the ear canal Swimmer's ear with symptoms such as itching, scaling, a red or moist ear canal, and pain that increases when you move the earlobe Normal ear wax",,Caring for ear discharge at home depends on the cause.,Drainage from the ear; Otorrhea; Ear bleeding; Bleeding from ear

Ear examination,An ear exam is performed when a health care provider looks inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.,,,,Otoscopy
Ear infection - acute,Suspected ear infections are one of the most common reasons parents take their children to the health care provider. The most common type of ear infection is called otitis media. It is caused by swelling and infection of the middle ear. The middle ear is located just behind the eardrum.,"The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection. Ear infections are common in infants and children because their eustachian tubes are easily clogged. Ear infections can also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children. Anything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked leads to more fluid buildup in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are: Allergies Colds and sinus infections Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat) Tobacco smoke Ear infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Milk may enter the eustachian tube, which may increase the risk of an ear infection. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection unless the eardrum has a hole in it. Other risk factors for acute ear infections include: Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children) Changes in altitude or climate Cold climate Exposure to smoke Family history of ear infections Not being breastfed Pacifier use Recent ear infection Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection) Birth defect, leading to deficiency in eustachian tube function","In infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection. Symptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include: Ear pain Fullness in the ear Feeling of general illness Nasal congestion Cough Lethargy Vomiting Diarrhea Hearing loss in the affected ear Drainage of fluid from the ear Loss of appetite The ear infection may start shortly after a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured. All acute ear infections involve fluid behind the eardrum. At home, you can use an electronic ear monitor to check for this fluid. You can buy this device at a drugstore. You still need to see a provider to confirm an ear infection.",,Otitis media - acute; Infection - inner ear; Middle ear infection - acute
Ear infection - chronic,"Chronic ear infection is fluid, swelling, or an infection behind the eardrum that does not go away or keeps coming back. It may cause long-term or permanent damage to the ear. It often involves a hole in the eardrum that does not heal.","The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur. A chronic ear infection develops when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away. A chronic ear infection may be caused by: An acute ear infection that does not completely go away Repeated ear infections Suppurative chronic otitis is a term used to describe an eardrum that keeps rupturing, draining, or swelling in the middle ear or mastoid area (the bone behind the ear) and does not go away. Ear infections are more common in children because their eustachian tubes are shorter, narrower, and more horizontal than in adults. Chronic ear infections are much less common than acute ear infections.","Symptoms of a chronic ear infection may be less severe than symptoms of an acute infection. The problem may go unnoticed and untreated for a long time. Symptoms may include: Ear pain or discomfort that is usually mild and feels like pressure in the ear Fever, usually low-grade Fussiness in infants Pus-like drainage from the ear Hearing loss Symptoms may continue or come and go.

Ear wax,The ear canal is lined with hair follicles. The ear canal also has glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.,"Ear wax protects the ear by: Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and small objects from entering and damaging the ear Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear, causing an impaction. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeper and block the ear canal. For this reason, health care providers recommend against trying to reach into your own ear to clean it.","Some of the common symptoms are: Earache Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged Noises in the ear ( tinnitus ) Partial hearing loss, which may get worse",,Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage; Hearing loss - ear wax
Earache,"An earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears. The pain may last a short time or be ongoing. Related conditions include:","The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection . Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw ( temporomandibular joint ), or your throat. This is called referred pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term (acute) ear infection Long-term (chronic) ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear",,"The following steps may help an earache: Place a cold pack or cold wet washcloth on the outer ear for 20 minutes to reduce pain. Chewing may help relieve the pain and pressure of an ear infection. (Gum can be a choking hazard for young children.) Resting in an upright position instead of lying down can reduce pressure in the middle ear. Over-the-counter ear drops can be used to relieve pain, as long as the eardrum has not ruptured. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can provide relief for children and adults with an earache. (Do not give aspirin to children.) For ear pain caused by a change of altitude , such as on an airplane: Swallow or chew gum as the plane descends. Allow infants to suck on a bottle or breastfeed. The following steps can help prevent earaches: Avoid smoking near children. Secondhand smoke is a major cause of ear infections in children. Prevent outer ear infections by not putting objects in the ear. Dry the ears well after bathing or swimming. Take steps to control allergies. Try to avoid allergy triggers. Try a steroid nasal spray to help reduce ear infections. (However, over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants do not prevent ear infections.)",Otalgia; Pain - ear; Ear pain

Ebola virus disease,"Ebola is a severe and often deadly disease caused by a virus. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding, and often, death.","WHERE EBOLA OCCURS Ebola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, several small outbreaks have occurred in Africa. The 2014 outbreak was the largest. The countries most affected in this outbreak included: Equitorial Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone Ebola has been previously reported in: Nigeria Senegal Spain United States Mali United Kingdom Italy For the latest information on Ebola worldwide, visit the World Health Organization website at www.who.int/health-topics/ebola#tab=tab_1 . HOW EBOLA CAN SPREAD Ebola does not spread as easily as more common illnesses such as colds, the flu, or measles. There is no evidence that the virus that causes Ebola is spread through the air or water. A person who has Ebola can't spread the disease until symptoms appear. Ebola can only spread between humans by direct contact with infected body fluids including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen. The virus can enter the body through a break in the skin or through mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose, and mouth. Ebola can also spread by contact with any surfaces, objects, or materials that have been in contact with body fluids from a sick person, such as: Bedclothes and bedding Clothing Bandages Needles and syringes Medical equipment In Africa, Ebola may also be spread by: Handling infected wild animals hunted for food (bushmeat) Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals Contact with infected bats Ebola does not spread through: Air Water Food Insects (mosquitoes) Health care workers and people caring for sick relatives are at high risk for developing Ebola because they are more likely to come in to direct contact with body fluids. The proper use of personal protective equipment personal protective equipment (PPE) greatly reduces this risk.","The time between exposure and when symptoms occur (incubation period) is 2 to 21 days. On average, symptoms develop in 8 to 10 days. Early symptoms of Ebola include: Fever greater than or equal to 100.4°F (38.0°C) Severe headache Sore throat Joint pain Muscle pain Weakness Fatigue Loss of appetite Rash Abdominal (stomach) pain Diarrhea Vomiting Red eyes Hiccups Late symptoms include: Bleeding from the mouth and rectum Bleeding from eyes, ears, and nose Organ failure A person who does not have symptoms 21 days after being exposed to Ebola will not develop the disease.",,Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebola virus infection; Viral hemorrhagic fever; Ebola
Ebstein anomaly,"Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart defect in which parts of the tricuspid valve are abnormal. The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium). In people with Ebstein anomaly, the positioning of the tricuspid valve and how it functions to separate the two chambers is abnormal.","The tricuspid valve is normally made of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. The leaflets open to allow blood to move from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. They close to prevent blood from moving from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps. In people with Ebstein anomaly, the leaflets are placed deeper into the right ventricle instead of the normal position. The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way. Instead of flowing out to the lungs, the blood flows back into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve). In many cases, people also have a hole in the wall separating the heart's two upper chambers ( atrial septal defect ) and blood flow across this hole may cause oxygen-poor blood to go to the body. This can cause cyanosis, a blue tint to the skin caused by oxygen-poor blood. Ebstein anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. The exact cause is unknown. The use of certain drugs (such as lithium or benzodiazepines) during pregnancy may play a role. The condition is rare. It is more common in white people.","The abnormality can be slight or very severe. Therefore, the symptoms can also range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can develop soon after birth, and can include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels. In severe cases, the baby appears very sick and has trouble breathing. In mild cases, the affected person may be asymptomatic for many years, sometimes even permanently. Symptoms in older children may include: Cough Failure to grow Fatigue Rapid breathing Shortness of breath Very fast heartbeat",,Ebstein's anomaly; Ebstein's malformation; Congenital heart defect - Ebstein; Birth defect heart - Ebstein; Cyanotic heart disease - Ebstein
Echinococcosis,Echinococcosis is an infection caused by either the Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis tapeworm. The infection is also called hydatid disease.,"Humans become infected when they swallow the tapeworm eggs in contaminated food. The eggs then form cysts inside the body. A cyst is a closed pocket or pouch. The cysts keep growing, which leads to symptoms. E granulosus is an infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs and livestock such as sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. These tapeworms are around 2 to 7 mm long. The infection is called cystic echinococcosis (CE). It leads to growth of cysts mainly in the lungs and liver. Cysts can also be found in the heart, bones, and brain. E multilocularis is the infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs, cats, rodents, and foxes. These tapeworms are around 1 to 4 mm long. The infection is called alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is a life-threatening condition because tumor-like growths form in the liver. Other organs, such as the lungs and brain can be affected. Children or young adults are more prone to get the infection. Echinococcosis is common in: Africa Central Asia Southern South America The Mediterranean The Middle East In rare cases, the infection is seen in the United States. It has been reported in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Risk factors include being exposed to: Cattle Deer Feces of dogs, foxes, wolves, or coyotes Pigs Sheep Camels","Cysts may produce no symptoms for 10 years or more. As the disease advances and the cysts get larger, symptoms may include: Pain in the upper right part of the abdomen (liver cyst) Increase in size of the abdomen due to swelling (liver cyst) Bloody sputum (lung cyst) Chest pain (lung cyst) Cough (lung cyst) Severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ) when cysts break open",,"Hydatidosis; Hydatid disease, Hydatid cyst disease; Alveolar cyst disease; Polycystic echinococcosis"
ECHO virus,"Enteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) viruses are a group of viruses that can lead to infections in different parts of the body, and skin rashes.","Echovirus is one of several families of viruses that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these are called enteroviruses. These infections are common. In the United States, they are most common in the summer and fall. You can catch the virus if you come into contact with stool contaminated by the virus, and possibly by breathing in air particles from an infected person. Serious infections with ECHO viruses are much less common but can be significant. For example, some cases of viral meningitis (inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) are caused by an ECHO virus.","Symptoms depend on the site of infection and may include: Croup (breathing difficulty and harsh cough) Mouth sores Skin rashes Sore throat Chest pain if the infection affects the heart muscle or sac-like covering around the heart ( pericarditis ) Severe headache, mental status changes, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light, if the infection affects the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis )",,Nonpolio enterovirus infection; Echovirus infection

Ectodermal dysplasias,"Ectodermal dysplasias is a group of conditions in which there is abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, or sweat glands.",There are many different types of ectodermal dysplasias. Each type of dysplasia is caused by specific mutations in certain genes. Dysplasia means abnormal development of cells or tissues. The most common form of ectodermal dysplasia usually affects men. Other forms of the disease affect men and women equally.,"People with ectodermal dysplasia have a lack of sweat glands. This means they may not sweat or sweat less than normal. In children with the disease, their bodies may have a problem controlling fevers. When the skin cannot sweat, it is hard for the body to control temperature properly. So even a mild illness can cause a very high fever. Adults with the disease can't tolerate a warm environment. Air conditioning and other measures are needed to keep a normal body temperature.

Ectopic Cushing syndrome,Ectopic Cushing syndrome is a form of Cushing syndrome in which a tumor outside the pituitary gland produces a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).,"Cushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the adrenal glands . Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One of the causes is if there is too much of the hormone ACTH in the blood. ACTH is usually made by the pituitary in small amounts and then signals the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Sometimes other cells outside the pituitary can make large amounts of ACTH. This is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. Ectopic means that something is occurring in an abnormal place in the body. Ectopic Cushing syndrome is caused by tumors that release ACTH. Tumors that can, in rare cases, release ACTH include: Benign carcinoid tumors of the lung Islet cell tumors of the pancreas Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid Small cell tumors of the lung Tumors of the thymus gland","Ectopic Cushing syndrome can cause a lot of different symptoms. Some people have many symptoms while others have only a few. Most people with any type of Cushing syndrome have: Round, red, and full face ( moon face ) Slow growth rate in children Weight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity) Skin changes that are often seen: Skin infections Thick, purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide) called striae on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts Thin skin with easy bruising Muscle and bone changes include: Backache, which occurs with routine activities Bone pain or tenderness Collection of fat between the shoulders and above the collar bone Rib and spine fractures caused by thinning of the bones Weak muscles, especially of the hips and shoulders Body-wide (systemic) problems may include: Type 2 diabetes mellitus High blood pressure High cholesterol and triglycerides Women may have: Excess hair growth on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs Periods that become irregular or stop Men may have: Decreased or no desire for sex Impotence Other symptoms that may occur include: Mental changes, such as depression , anxiety, or changes in behavior Fatigue Headache Increased thirst and urination",,Cushing syndrome - ectopic; Ectopic ACTH syndrome; Ectopic Cushing's syndrome
Ectopic heartbeat,Ectopic heartbeats are changes in a heartbeat that is otherwise normal. These changes lead to extra or skipped heartbeats. There is often not a clear cause for these changes. They are common.,"Ectopic heartbeats are sometimes seen with: Changes in the blood, such as a low potassium level ( hypokalemia ) Decrease in blood supply to the heart When the heart is enlarged or structurally abnormal Ectopic beats may be caused or made worse by smoking, alcohol use , caffeine , stimulant medicines, and some street drugs. Ectopic heartbeats are rare in children without heart disease that was present at birth (congenital). Most extra heartbeats in children are PACs. These are often benign. In adults, ectopic heartbeats are common. They are most often due to PACs or PVCs. Your health care provider should look into the cause when they are frequent. Treatment is directed at symptoms and the underlying cause.","Symptoms include: Feeling your heartbeat ( palpitations ) Feeling like your heart stopped or skipped a beat Feeling of occasional, forceful beats Note: There may be no symptoms.",,PVB (premature ventricular beat); Premature beats; PVC (premature ventricular complex/contraction); Extrasystole; Premature supraventricular contractions; PAC; Premature atrial contraction; Abnormal heartbeat
Ectopic pregnancy,An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus).,"In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include: Birth defect in the fallopian tubes Scarring after a ruptured appendix Endometriosis Having had an ectopic pregnancy in the past Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs History of prior abdominal surgery The following also increase risk for an ectopic pregnancy: Age over 35 Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD) Having your fallopian tubes tied Having had surgery to untie fallopian tubes to become pregnant Having had many sexual partners Sexually transmitted infections (STI) Some infertility treatments Sometimes, the cause is not known. Hormones may play a role. The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. In rare cases, this can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix . An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control.","Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy may include: Abnormal vaginal bleeding Mild cramping on one side of the pelvis No periods Pain in the lower belly or pelvic area If the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include: Fainting or feeling faint Intense pressure in the rectum Low blood pressure Pain in the shoulder area Severe, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen",,Tubal pregnancy; Cervical pregnancy; Tubal ligation - ectopic pregnancy
Ectropion,Ectropion is the turning out of the eyelid so that the inner surface is exposed. It most often affects the lower eyelid.,"Ectropion is very often caused by the aging process. The connective (supporting) tissue of the eyelid becomes weak. This causes the lid to turn out so that the inside of the lower lid is no longer against the eyeball. It can also be caused by: A defect that occurs before birth (for example, in children with Down syndrome ) Facial muscle weakness Scar tissue from burns or injuries","Symptoms include: Dry, painful eyes Excess tearing of the eye ( epiphora ) Eyelid turns outward (downward) Long-term (chronic) conjunctivitis Keratitis Redness of the lid and white part of the eye If you have ectropion, you will most likely have excess tearing. This happens because the eye gets dry, then makes more tears. The excess tears can't get into the tear drainage duct. Therefore, they build up inside the lower lid and then spill over the edge of the lid onto the cheek.",,

Ehrlichiosis,Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial infection transmitted by the bite of a tick.,"Ehrlichiosis is caused by bacteria that belong to the family called rickettsiae. Rickettsial bacteria cause a number of serious diseases worldwide, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus . All of these diseases are spread to humans by a tick , flea, or mite bite. Scientists first described ehrlichiosis in 1990. There are two types of the disease in the United States: Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the rickettsial bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). It is caused by the rickettsial bacteria called Anaplasma phagocytophilum . Ehrlichia bacteria can be carried by the: American dog tick Deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ), which can also cause Lyme disease Lone Star tick In the United States, HME is found mainly in the southern central states and the Southeast. HGE is found mainly in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Risk factors for ehrlichiosis include: Living near an area with a lot of ticks Owning a pet that may bring a tick home Walking or playing in high grasses","The incubation period between the tick bite and when symptoms occur is about 7 to 14 days. Symptoms may seem like the flu (influenza), and may include: Fever and chills Headache Muscle aches Nausea Other possible symptoms: Diarrhea Fine pinhead-sized areas of bleeding into the skin (petechial rash) Flat red rash (maculopapular rash), which is uncommon General ill feeling ( malaise ) A rash appears in fewer than one third of cases. Sometimes, the disease may be mistaken for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if the rash is present. The symptoms are often mild, but people are sometimes sick enough to see a health care provider.",,Human monocytic ehrlichiosis; HME; Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis; HGE; Human granulocytic anaplasmosis; HGA
Eisenmenger syndrome,Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition that affects blood flow from the heart to the lungs in some people who were born with structural problems of the heart.,"Eisenmenger syndrome is a condition that results from abnormal blood circulation caused by a defect in the heart. Most often, people with this condition are born with a hole between the two larger pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart ( ventricular septal defect ). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include: Atrioventricular canal defect Atrial septal defect Cyanotic heart disease Patent ductus arteriosus Truncus arteriosus Over many years, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood flow goes backward through the hole between the two pumping chambers. This allows oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body. Eisenmenger syndrome may begin to develop before a child reaches puberty. However, it also can develop in young adulthood, and may progress throughout young adulthood.","Symptoms include: Bluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis) Rounded fingernails and toenails (clubbing) Numbness and tingling of fingers and toes Chest pain Coughing up blood Dizziness Fainting Feeling tired Shortness of breath Skipped heartbeats (palpitations) Stroke Swelling in the joints caused by too much uric acid (gout)",,Eisenmenger complex; Eisenmenger disease; Eisenmenger reaction; Eisenmenger physiology; Congenital heart defect - Eisenmenger; Cyanotic heart disease - Eisenmenger; Birth defect heart - Eisenmenger; Eisenmenger's syndrome
Elbow pain,This article describes pain or other discomfort in the elbow that is not related to direct injury.,"Elbow pain can be caused by many problems. A common cause in adults is tendinitis . This is inflammation and injury to the tendons, which are soft tissues that attach muscle to bone. People who play racquet sports are most likely to injure the tendons on the outside of the elbow. This condition is commonly called tennis elbow . Golfers are more likely to injure the tendons on the inside of the elbow . Other common causes of elbow tendinitis are gardening, playing baseball, using a screwdriver, or overusing your wrist and arm. Young children commonly develop ""nursemaid elbow,"" which often occurs when someone is pulling on their straightened arm. The bones are stretched apart momentarily and a ligament slips in between. It becomes trapped when the bones try to snap back into place. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial dislocation ). This often gets better on its own when the ligament slips back into place. Surgery is usually not needed. Other common causes of elbow pain are: Bursitis -- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin Arthritis -- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow Elbow strains Infection of the elbow Tendon tears -- biceps rupture",,"Gently try to move the elbow and increase your range of motion.

Empty sella syndrome,Empty sella syndrome is a condition in which the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened.,"The pituitary is a small gland located just underneath the brain. It is attached to the bottom of the brain by the pituitary stalk. The pituitary sits protected inside a saddle-like bony compartment in the base of the skull. This compartment is called the sella turcica, but often just called the sella. When the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on an MRI scan. This makes the area of the pituitary gland look like an ""empty sella."" But the sella is not actually empty. It is often filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. With empty sella syndrome, CSF has leaked into the sella turcica, putting pressure on the pituitary. This causes the gland to shrink or flatten. Primary empty sella syndrome occurs when one of the layers (arachnoid) covering the outside of the brain bulges down into the sella and presses on the pituitary. Secondary empty sella syndrome occurs when the sella is empty because the pituitary gland has been damaged by: A tumor Radiation therapy Surgery Trauma Empty sella syndrome may be seen in a condition called pseudotumor cerebri , which mainly affects young, obese women and causes the CSF to be under higher pressure. The pituitary gland makes several hormones that control other glands and hormones in the body, including: Adrenal glands Liver hormone related to growth (insulin-like growth factor-1) Ovaries Testicles Thyroid A problem with the pituitary gland can lead to problems with any of the above glands and abnormal hormone levels of these glands.","Often, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function.

Empyema,Empyema is a collection of pus in the space between the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall (pleural space).,"Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads directly from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space. There can be 2 cups (1/2 liter) or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs. Risk factors include: Bacterial pneumonia Tuberculosis Chest surgery Lung abscess Trauma or injury to the chest In rare cases, empyema can occur after thoracentesis . This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall to remove fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment.","Symptoms of empyema may include any of the following: Chest pain , which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy) Dry cough Excessive sweating , especially night sweats Fever and chills General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Shortness of breath Weight loss (unintentional)",,Empyema - pleural; Pyothorax; Pleurisy - purulent
Encephalitis,"Encephalitis is irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections.","Encephalitis is a rare condition. It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and older adults are more likely to have a severe case. Encephalitis is most often caused by a virus. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure can occur through: Breathing in droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat from an infected person Contaminated food or drink Mosquito, tick, and other insect bites Skin contact Different viruses occur in different geographic locations. Many cases occur during a certain season. Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns. Routine vaccination has greatly reduced encephalitis due to some viruses, including: Measles Mumps Polio Rabies Rubella Varicella (chickenpox) Other viruses that cause encephalitis include: Adenovirus Coxsackievirus Cytomegalovirus Eastern equine encephalitis virus Echovirus Japanese encephalitis, which occurs in Asia West Nile virus After the virus enters the body, the brain tissue swells. This swelling may destroy nerve cells, and cause bleeding in the brain and brain damage. Other causes of encephalitis may include: An allergic reaction to vaccinations Autoimmune disease Bacterial infections such as Lyme disease , syphilis , and tuberculosis Parasites such as roundworms, cysticercosis , and toxoplasmosis in people with HIV/AIDS and other people who have a weakened immune system The effects of cancer","Some people may have symptoms of a cold or stomach infection before encephalitis symptoms begin.

Endocardial cushion defect,"Endocardial cushion defect (ECD) is an abnormal heart condition. The walls separating all four chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent. Also, the valves separating the upper and lower chambers of the heart have defects during formation. ECD is a congenital heart disease, which means it is present from birth.","ECD occurs while a baby is still growing in the womb (uterus). The endocardial cushions are two thicker areas that develop into the walls (septum) that divide the four chambers of the heart. They also form the mitral and tricuspid valves. These are the valves that separate the atria (top collecting chambers) from the ventricles (bottom pumping chambers). The lack of separation between the two sides of the heart causes several problems: Increased blood flow to the lungs. This results in increased pressure in the lungs. In ECD, blood flows through the abnormal openings from the left to the right side of the heart, then to the lungs. More blood flow into the lungs makes the blood pressure in the lungs rise. Heart failure . The extra effort needed to pump makes the heart work harder than normal. The heart muscle may enlarge and weaken. This can cause swelling in the baby, problems in breathing, and difficulty in feeding and growing. Cyanosis . As the blood pressure increases in the lungs, blood starts to flow from the right side of the heart to the left. The oxygen-poor blood mixes with the oxygen-rich blood. As a result, blood with less oxygen than usual is pumped out to the body. This causes cyanosis, or bluish skin. There are two types of ECD: Complete ECD. This condition involves an atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). People with a complete ECD have only one large heart valve (common AV valve) instead of two distinct valves (mitral and tricuspid). Partial (or incomplete) ECD. In this condition, only an ASD, or an ASD and VSD are present. There are two distinct valves, but one of them (the mitral valve) is often abnormal with an opening (cleft) in it. This defect can leak blood back through the valve. ECD is strongly linked to Down syndrome . Several gene changes are also linked to ECD. However, the exact cause of ECD is unknown. ECD may be associated with other congenital heart defects, such as: Double outlet right ventricle Single ventricle Transposition of the great vessels Tetralogy of Fallot","Symptoms of ECD may include: Tires easily Bluish skin color, also known as cyanosis (the lips may also be blue) Feeding difficulties Failure to gain weight and grow Frequent pneumonia

Other factors that may increase the risk for endometrial polyps are: Obesity Tamoxifen, a treatment for breast cancer Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy Family history of Lynch syndrome or Cowden syndrome (genetic conditions that run in families) Endometrial polyps are common in women between 20 to 40 years of age.","You may not have any symptoms of endometrial polyps. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Menstrual bleeding that is not regular or predictable Long or heavy menstrual bleeding Bleeding between periods Bleeding from the vagina after menopause Trouble getting or staying pregnant ( infertility )",,Uterine polyps; Uterine bleeding - polyps; Vaginal bleeding - polyps
Endometriosis,"Endometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of your womb (uterus) grow in other areas of your body. This can cause pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, vaginal bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (infertility).","Every month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period. Endometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your: Ovaries Fallopian tubes Bowel Rectum Bladder Lining of your pelvic area It can grow in other areas of the body, too. These growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility. The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition. Endometriosis is common. It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35. You are more likely to develop endometriosis if you: Have a mother or sister with endometriosis Started your period at a young age Never had children Have frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days","Pain is the main symptom of endometriosis. You may have: Painful periods -- Cramps or pain in your lower belly may begin a week or two before your period. Cramps may be steady and range from dull to severe. Pain during or after sexual intercourse. Pain with urination. Pain with bowel movements. Long-term pelvic or low back pain that may occur at any time and last for 6 months or more. Other symptoms of endometriosis include: Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods Infertility (difficulty getting or staying pregnant) You may not have any symptoms. Some women with a lot of tissue in their pelvis have no pain at all, while some women with milder disease have severe pain.",,Pelvic pain - endometriosis; Endometrioma
Endometritis,Endometritis is an inflammation or irritation of the lining of the uterus (the endometrium). It is not the same as endometriosis.,"Endometritis is caused by an infection in the uterus. It can be due to chlamydia, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, or a mix of normal vaginal bacteria. It is more likely to occur after miscarriage or childbirth. It is also more common after a long labor or C-section. The risk for endometritis is higher after having a pelvic procedure that is done through the cervix. Such procedures include: D and C (dilation and curettage) Endometrial biopsy Hysteroscopy Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) Childbirth (more common after C-section than vaginal birth) Endometritis can occur at the same time as other pelvic infections.","Symptoms may include: Swelling of the abdomen Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Discomfort with bowel movement (including constipation) Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling Pain in lower abdomen or pelvic region (uterine pain)",,

Enlarged adenoids,The adenoids are lymph tissues that sit in your upper airway between your nose and the back of your throat. They are similar to the tonsils.,Enlarged adenoids may be normal. They may grow bigger when the baby grows in the womb. The adenoids help the body prevent or fight infections by trapping bacteria and germs. Infections can cause the adenoids to become swollen. The adenoids may stay enlarged even when you are not sick.,"Children with enlarged adenoids often breathe through the mouth because the nose is blocked. Mouth breathing occurs mostly at night, but may be present during the day. Mouth breathing may lead to the following symptoms: Bad breath Cracked lips Dry mouth Persistent runny nose or nasal congestion Enlarged adenoids may also cause sleep problems. A child may: Be restless while sleeping Snore a lot Have episodes of not breathing during sleep ( sleep apnea ) Children with enlarged adenoids may also have more frequent ear infections.",,Adenoids - enlarged
Enlarged liver,Enlarged liver refers to swelling of the liver beyond its normal size. Hepatomegaly is another word to describe this problem.,"The liver is involved in many of the body's functions. Its function is affected by many conditions that can cause hepatomegaly, including: Alcohol use (especially alcohol abuse) Cancer metastases (spread of cancer to the liver) Congestive heart failure Glycogen storage disease Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatocellular carcinoma Hereditary fructose intolerance Infectious mononucleosis Leukemia Niemann-Pick disease Primary biliary cholangitis Reye syndrome Sarcoidosis Sclerosing cholangitis Portal vein thrombosis Steatosis (fat in the liver from metabolic problems such as diabetes, obesity, and high triglycerides, also called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH)",,,Hepatosplenomegaly; Enlarged liver; Liver enlargement
Enlarged prostate,"The prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine passes out of the body.","The actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and changes in the cells of the testicles may have a role in the growth of the gland, as well as testosterone levels. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH. Also, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size. However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate. Some facts about prostate enlargement: The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age. BPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough. A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40. More than 90% of men over age 80 have the condition. No risk factors have been identified, other than having normally-functioning testicles.",Less than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease. Symptoms may include: Dribbling at the end of urinating Inability to urinate (urinary retention) Incomplete emptying of your bladder Incontinence Needing to urinate 2 or more times per night Pain with urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection) Slowed or delayed start of the urinary stream Straining to urinate Strong and sudden urge to urinate Weak urine stream,,BPH; Benign prostatic hyperplasia (hypertrophy); Prostate - enlarged
Enteritis,Enteritis is inflammation of the small intestine.,"Enteritis is most often caused by eating or drinking things that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The germs settle in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling. Enteritis may also be caused by: An autoimmune condition, such as Crohn disease Certain medicines, including NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium) and cocaine Damage from radiation therapy Celiac disease Tropical sprue Whipple disease The inflammation can also involve the stomach ( gastritis ) and large intestine ( colitis ). Risk factors include: Recent stomach flu among household members Recent travel Exposure to unclean water Types of enteritis include: Bacterial gastroenteritis Campylobacter enteritis E coli enteritis Food poisoning Radiation enteritis Salmonella enteritis Shigella enteritis Staph aureus food poisoning Non-bacterial infections such as viruses and protozoa",The symptoms may begin hours to days after you become infected.

The enterotoxin enters your stomach and intestines if you eat contaminated food or water. It can also be produced by bacteria in the intestines. This causes symptoms such as cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.",,,,
Entropion,Entropion is the turning in of an edge of an eyelid. This causes the lashes to rub against the eye. It most often is seen on the lower eyelid.,"Entropion can be present at birth (congenital). In babies, it rarely causes problems because the lashes are very soft and do not easily damage the eye. In older people, the condition is most often caused by a spasm or weakening of the muscles surrounding the lower part of the eye. Another cause can be trachoma infection, which can lead to scarring of the inner side of the lid. This is rare in North America and Europe. However, trachoma scarring is one of the three leading causes of blindness in the world. Risk factors for entropion are: Aging Chemical burn Infection with trachoma",Symptoms include: Decreased vision if the cornea is damaged Excessive tearing Eye discomfort or pain Eye irritation Redness,,Eyelid - entropion; Eye pain - entropion; Tearing - entropion

Eosinophilic esophagitis,"Eosinophilic esophagitis involves a buildup of a specific type of white blood cells, called eosinophils, in the lining of your esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. The buildup of eosinophils that causes eosinophilic esophagitis is due to a reaction to foods or allergens.","The exact cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is not known. It is believed that an immune reaction to certain foods leads to a buildup of eosinophils. As a result, the lining of the esophagus becomes swollen and inflamed. Most people with this disorder have a family or personal history of allergies or asthma. Triggers such as mold, pollen, and dust mites may also play a role.","Eosinophilic esophagitis can affect both children and adults. Symptoms in children include: Problems feeding or eating Abdominal pain Vomiting Problems swallowing Food getting stuck in the esophagus Poor weight gain or weight loss, poor growth, and malnutrition Symptoms in adults include: Food getting stuck when swallowing (dysphagia) Chest pain Heartburn Upper abdominal pain Backflow of undigested food (regurgitation) Reflux in the esophagus that does not get better with medicine",,
Eosinophilic fasciitis,"Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a syndrome in which tissue under the skin and over the muscle, called fascia, becomes swollen, inflamed and thick. The skin on the arms, legs, neck, abdomen or feet can swell quickly. The condition is very rare.","The cause of EF is unknown. Rare cases have occurred after taking L-tryptophan supplements. In people with this condition, white blood cells, called eosinophils, build up in the muscles and tissues. Eosinophils are linked to allergic reactions.

Epidermoid cyst,"An epidermoid cyst is a closed sac under the skin, or a skin lump, filled with dead skin cells.","Epidermoid cysts are very common. Their cause is unknown. The cysts are formed when elements of the surface skin get under the skin surface. The cyst then becomes filled with dead skin because as the skin grows, it can't be shed as it can elsewhere on the body. When a cyst reaches a certain size, it usually stops growing. People with these cysts may have family members who also have them. These cysts are more common in adults than in children. Sometimes, epidermoid cysts are called sebaceous cysts. This is not correct because the contents of the two types of cysts are different. Epidermoid cysts are filled with dead skin cells, while true sebaceous cysts are filled with yellowish oily material. (A true sebaceous cyst is called a steatocystoma.)","The main symptom is usually a small, non-painful lump beneath the skin. The lump is usually found on the face, neck, and trunk. It will often have a tiny hole or pit in the center. It usually grows slowly and is not painful. If the lump becomes infected or inflamed, other symptoms may include: Skin redness Tender or sore skin Warm skin in the affected area Grayish-white, cheesy, foul-smelling material that drains from the cyst",,Epidermal cyst; Keratin cyst; Epidermal inclusion cyst; Follicular infundibular cyst
Epidermolysis bullosa,Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters form after a minor injury. It is passed down in families.,"There are 3 main types of EB. They are: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Junctional epidermolysis bullosa EB can vary from minor to fatal. The minor forms causes blistering of the skin. The fatal forms affect other organs. Most types of this condition start at birth or soon after. It can be hard to identify the exact type of EB a person has, although specific genetic markers are now available for most. Family history is a risk factor. The risk is higher if a parent has this condition. Another rare type of EB is called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. This form develops after birth. It is an autoimmune disorder, which means the body attacks itself.","Depending on the form of EB, symptoms can include: Alopecia (hair loss) Blisters around the eyes and nose Blisters in or around the mouth and throat, causing feeding problems or swallowing difficulty Blisters on the skin as a result of minor injury or temperature change, especially of the feet Blistering that is present at birth Dental problems, such as tooth decay Hoarse cry, cough, or other breathing problems Tiny white bumps on previously injured skin Nail loss or deformed nails Mitten-like hands or feet Thickening of skin on hands and feet Muscle, heart, brain, gastrointestinal, bone, or kidney issues",,EB; Junctional epidermolysis bullosa; Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa; Hemidesmosomal epidermolysis bullosa; Weber-Cockayne syndrome; Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
Epididymitis,Epididymitis is swelling (inflammation) of the tube that connects the testicle with the vas deferens. The tube is called the epididymis.,"Epididymitis is most common in men ages 19 to 35. It is most often caused by a bacterial infection. Infection often begins in the urethra, the prostate, or the bladder. Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are most often the cause of the problem in young heterosexual men. In children and older men, it is more commonly caused by E coli and similar bacteria. This is also true in men who have sex with men. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) can cause epididymitis. Other bacteria (such as Ureaplasma) may also cause the condition. Amiodarone is a medicine which prevents abnormal heart rhythms. This medicine can also cause epididymitis. The following increase the risk for epididymitis: Recent surgery Past structural problems in the urinary tract Regular use of a urethral catheter Sexual intercourse with more than one partner and not using condoms Enlarged prostate","Epididymitis may begin with: Low fever Chills Feeling of heaviness in the testicle area The testicle area will get more sensitive to pressure. It will become painful as the condition progresses. An infection in the epididymis can easily spread to the testicle. Other symptoms include: Blood in the semen Discharge from the urethra (the opening at the end of the penis) Discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvis Lump near the testicle Less common symptoms are: Pain during ejaculation Pain or burning during urination Painful scrotal swelling (epididymis is enlarged) Tender, swollen, and painful groin area on affected side Testicle pain that gets worse during a bowel movement Symptoms of epididymitis may be similar to those of testicular torsion , which requires emergent treatment.",,
Epidural abscess,An epidural abscess is a collection of pus (infected material) and germs between the outer covering of the brain and spinal cord and the bones of the skull or spine. The abscess causes swelling in the area.,"Epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine. The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found. An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following: Chronic ear infections Chronic sinusitis Head injury Mastoiditis Recent neurosurgery An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following: Prior back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine Bloodstream infections Boils , especially on the back or scalp Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis) People who inject drugs are also at increased risk.","Spinal epidural abscess may cause these symptoms: Bowel or bladder incontinence Difficulty urinating (urinary retention) Fever and back pain Intracranial epidural abscess may cause these symptoms: Fever Headache Lethargy Nausea and vomiting Pain at the site of recent surgery that gets worse (especially if fever is present) Nervous system symptoms depend on the location of the abscess and may include: Decreased ability to move any part of the body Loss of sensation in any area of the body, or abnormal changes in sensation Weakness",,Abscess - epidural; Spinal abscess
Epidural hematoma,An epidural hematoma (EDH) is bleeding between the inside of the skull and the outer covering of the brain (called the dura mater).,"An EDH is often caused by a skull fracture during childhood or adolescence. The membrane covering the brain is not as closely attached to the skull as it is in older people and children younger than 2 years. Therefore, this type of bleeding is more common in young people. An EDH can also occur due to rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery. The blood vessel then bleeds into the space between the dura and the skull. The affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures. The fractures are most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle, bicycle, skateboard, snow boarding, or automobile accidents. Less severe blunt trauma, such as getting hit by a baseball, can also result in an EDH. Rapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain. The pressure inside the head ( intracranial pressure, ICP ) increases quickly. This pressure may result in more brain injury.","Contact your health care provider for any head injury that results in even a brief loss of consciousness , or if there are any other symptoms after a head injury (even without loss of consciousness). The typical pattern of symptoms that indicate an EDH is a loss of consciousness, followed by alertness, then loss of consciousness again. But this pattern may not appear in all people. The most important symptoms of an EDH are: Confusion Dizziness Drowsiness or altered level of alertness Enlarged pupil in one eye Headache (severe) Head injury or trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to unconsciousness Nausea or vomiting Weakness in part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil Seizures can occur as a result of head impact The symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation. Sometimes, bleeding does not start for hours after a head injury. The symptoms of pressure on the brain also do not occur right away.",,Extradural hematoma; Extradural hemorrhage; Epidural hemorrhage; EDH

Epiglottitis,Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis. This is the tissue-lined cartilage that covers the trachea (windpipe) while swallowing. Epiglottitis can be a life-threatening disease.,"The epiglottis is a stiff, yet flexible tissue (called cartilage) at the back of the tongue. It closes your windpipe (trachea) when you swallow so food does not enter your airway. This helps prevent coughing or choking after swallowing. In children, epiglottitis is usually caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae ( H influenzae ) type B. In adults, it is often due to other bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , or viruses such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster. Epiglottitis is now very uncommon because the H influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine is given routinely to all children. The disease was once most often seen in children ages 2 through 6. In rare cases, epiglottitis can occur in adults.","Epiglottitis begins with a high fever and sore throat. Other symptoms may include: Abnormal breathing sounds ( stridor ) Fever Blue skin color ( cyanosis ) Drooling Difficulty breathing (the person may need to sit upright and lean slightly forward to breathe) Difficulty swallowing Voice changes (hoarseness) The airways can become totally blocked, which can result in cardiac arrest and death.",,Supraglottitis
Epilepsy,Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal electrical activity of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior such as bodily movements.,"Epilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.) Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Common causes of epilepsy include: Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) Dementia , such as Alzheimer disease Traumatic brain injury Infections, including brain abscess , meningitis , encephalitis , and HIV/AIDS Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect) Brain injury that occurs during or near birth Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria ) Brain tumor Abnormal blood vessels in the brain Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue Seizure disorders that run in families (hereditary epilepsy) Epileptic seizures can happen to anyone at any age. However, they're more common in young children and people age 65 years and older. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.","Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness ( convulsion ). The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected. Most of the time, for people with epilepsy, their seizures are similar to ones before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura. Your health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have: Absence seizures (also called non-motor seizures) include seizures involving a change in behavior but without changes in motor movement (such as staring spells). They may occur along with generalized seizures. Focal onset seizures may occur with no change in awareness. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected. These seizures may spread to the whole brain. Generalized seizures involve both sides of the brain and cause impaired awareness. Abnormal movements involving the whole body are often present. Clenching of the jaw and losing control of the urine or bowels may occur.",,Seizure disorder; Epileptic - epilepsy

Epispadias,"Epispadias is a rare defect that is present at birth. In this condition, the urethra does not develop into a full tube. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. The urine exits the body from the wrong place with epispadias.","The causes of epispadias are not known. It may occur because the pubic bone does not develop properly. Epispadias can occur with a rare birth defect called bladder exstrophy. In this birth defect, the bladder is open through the wall of the abdomen. Epispadias can also occur with other birth defects. The condition occurs more often in boys than girls. It is most often diagnosed at birth or soon afterward.","Males will have a short, wide penis with an abnormal curve. The urethra most often opens on the top or side of the penis instead of the tip. However, the urethra may be open along the whole length of the penis. Females have an abnormal clitoris and labia.

Erection problems,"An erection problem occurs when a man cannot get or keep an erection that is firm enough for intercourse. You may not be able to get an erection at all. Or, you may lose the erection during intercourse before you are ready. Erection problems do not usually affect your sex drive.","To get an erection, your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels all need to work together. If something gets in the way of these normal functions, it can lead to erection problems. An erection problem is usually not ""all in your head."" In fact, most erection problems have a physical cause. Below are some common physical causes. Disease: Diabetes High blood pressure Heart or thyroid conditions Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) Depression Nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease Medicines: Antidepressants Blood pressure medicines (especially beta-blockers) Heart medicines, such as digoxin Sleeping pills Some peptic ulcer medicines Other physical causes: Low testosterone levels. This can make it difficult to get an erection. It can also reduce a man's sex drive. Nerve damage from prostate surgery. Nicotine, alcohol, or cocaine use. Spinal cord injury. In some cases, your emotions or relationship problems can lead to ED, such as: Poor communication with your partner. Feelings of doubt and failure. Stress, fear, anxiety, or anger. Expecting too much from sex. This can make sex a task instead of a pleasure. Erection problems can affect men at any age, but are more common as you get older. Physical causes are more common in older men. Emotional causes are more common in younger men. If you have erections in the morning or at night while you sleep, it is likely not a physical cause. Most men have 3 to 5 erections at night that last about 30 minutes.

It can occur in people with poorly-controlled diabetes or in people who take some medicines, such as isotretinoin, estrogens, and cyclosporine, which can increase the triglyceride levels. Cholesterol and triglycerides are types of fats that naturally occur in your blood. High levels increase the risk for heart disease and other health problems. When diabetes is not well-controlled, the insufficient insulin level makes it harder for the body to break down fats in the blood. This increases the level of fats in the blood. The extra fat can collect under the skin to form small bumps which are xanthomas.","The skin bumps may vary in color from yellow, orange-yellow, red-yellow, to red. A small red halo may form around the bump. The bumps are: Pea-sized Waxy Firm While harmless by themselves, the bumps may be itchy and tender.

Everyone has some tremor at times, but the movements are usually so small that they can't be seen. ET affects both men and women. It is most common in people older than 65 years. The exact cause of ET is unknown. Research suggests that the part of the brain that controls muscle movements does not work correctly in people with ET. If an ET occurs in more than one member of a family, it is called a familial tremor. This type of ET is passed down through families (inherited). This suggests that genes play a role in its cause. Familial tremor is usually a dominant trait. This means that you only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the tremor. It often starts in early middle age, but may be seen in people who are older or younger, or even in children.","The tremor is more likely to be noticed in the forearm and hands. The arms, head, eyelids, or other muscles may also be affected. The tremor rarely occurs in the legs or feet. A person with ET may have trouble holding or using small objects such as silverware or a pen. The shaking most often involves small, rapid movements occurring 4 to 12 times a second. Specific symptoms may include: Head nodding A shaking or quivering sound to the voice if the tremor affects the voice box Problems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands The tremors may: Occur during movement (action-related tremor) and may be less noticeable with rest Come and go, but often get worse with age Worsen with stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, and certain medicines Not affect both sides of the body the same way Improve slightly by drinking a small amount of alcohol",,Tremor - essential; Familial tremor; Tremor - familial; Benign essential tremor; Shaking - essential tremor

Apply warm compress to soften eye crusts if they have formed. Washing the eyelids with baby shampoo on a cotton applicator can also help remove crusts. Using artificial tears 4 to 6 times a day can be helpful for almost all causes of burning and irritation, especially dry eyes. If you have allergies, try to avoid the cause (pets, grasses, cosmetics) as much as possible. Your health care provider may give you antihistamine eye drops to help with allergies. Pink eye or viral conjunctivitis causes a red or bloodshot eye and excessive tearing. It may be highly contagious for the first few days. The infection will run its course in about 10 days. If you suspect pink eye: Wash your hands often Avoid touching the unaffected eye",Itching - burning eyes; Burning eyes
Eye emergencies,"Eye emergencies include cuts, scratches, objects in the eye, burns, chemical exposure, and blunt injuries to the eye or eyelid. Certain eye infections and other medical conditions, such as blood clots or glaucoma, may also need medical care right away. Since the eye is easily damaged, any of these conditions can lead to vision loss if untreated.","Eye emergencies include any of the following: BLUNT TRAUMA Blunt trauma to the eye or face often causes bleeding under the skin that leaves a bruise called a ""black eye."" The tissue around the eye turns black and blue, gradually becoming purple, green, and yellow over several days as the blood is absorbed. The abnormal color disappears within 2 weeks. Swelling of the eyelid and tissue around the eye may also occur. Sometimes, serious damage to the eye itself occurs from the pressure of a swollen eyelid or face. Certain types of skull fractures can cause bruising around the eyes, even without direct injury to the eye. Common causes of blunt trauma include things like fists, tennis balls, and airbags. Blunt trauma can cause a hyphema , which is blood inside the front of the eye. The blood may block your view of the iris and pupil. PENETRATING TRAUMA Penetrating trauma may be caused by things such as knives, ice picks, sticks, nails, and gun shots. Injuries can be serious and usually require repair by a surgeon. Loss of the eye is not uncommon in serious injuries. Foreign bodies thrown at high speed by machining, grinding, or hammering are other causes of penetrating trauma. CHEMICAL INJURY A chemical injury to the eye can be caused by a work-related accident. It can also be caused by common household products such as cleaning solutions, garden chemicals, solvents, or other types of chemicals. Fumes and aerosols can also cause chemical burns. The cornea is the clear (transparent) tissue covering the front of the eye. With acid burns, the haze on the cornea caused by the injury often clears and there is a good chance of recovery. Alkaline substances such as lime, lye, drain cleaners, and sodium hydroxide found in refrigeration equipment may cause permanent damage to the cornea. It is important to flush out the eye with large amounts of clean water or salt water (saline). This kind of injury needs medical care right away. FOREIGN OBJECT IN THE EYE AND CORNEAL INJURIES The cornea is the clear (transparent) tissue covering the front of the eye. Dust, sand, and other debris can easily become embedded in the cornea without entering the eyeball. Persistent pain, sensitivity to light, and redness are signs that treatment is needed. An injury to the eyelid may be a sign of a severe injury to the eye itself.","Depending on the type of injury, any of the following symptoms may be present: Bleeding or other discharge from or around the eye Bruising Decreased vision Double vision Eye pain Headache Itchy eyes Loss of vision , total or partial, one eye or both Pupils of unequal size Redness -- bloodshot appearance Sensation of something in the eye Sensitivity to light Stinging or burning in the eye",,
Eye floaters,"The floating specks you sometimes see in front of your eyes are not on the surface of your eyes but inside them. They are made up of bits of cell debris that drift around in the fluid (vitreous) in the back of your eye. Floaters may look like spots, specks, bubbles, threads, or clumps. Most adults have at least a few floaters. There are times when they may be more visible than at other times, such as when you are reading, especially if the floater is dense or dark.",,,,

Eye pain,"Pain in the eye may be described as a burning, throbbing, aching, or stabbing sensation in or around the eye. It may also feel like you have a foreign object in your eye.","Many things can cause pain in or around the eye. If the pain is severe, does not go away, or causes vision loss, seek medical attention immediately. Some things that can cause eye pain are: Infections Inflammation Contact lens problems Dry eye Acute glaucoma Sinus problems Neuropathy Eyestrain Headache Flu",,"Resting your eyes should relieve discomfort due to eye strain. If you wear contacts, try using glasses for a few days to see if the pain goes away.",Ophthalmalgia; Pain - eye
Eye redness,Eye redness is most often due to swollen or dilated blood vessels. This makes the surface of the eye look red or bloodshot.,"Bloodshot eyes appear red because the vessels at the surface of the white portion of the eye ( sclera ) become swollen. Vessels may swell due to: Eye dryness Too much sun exposure Dust or other particles in the eye Allergies Infection Injury Eye infections or inflammation can cause redness as well as possible itching, discharge, pain, or vision problems. These may be due to: Blepharitis : Swelling along the edge of the eyelid. Conjunctivitis : Swelling or infection of the clear tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the surface of the eye (the conjunctiva). This is often referred to as ""pink eye."" Corneal ulcers : Sores on the cornea most often caused by a serious bacterial or viral infection. Uveitis : Inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. The cause is most often not known. It may be related to an autoimmune disorder, infection, or exposure to toxins. The type of uveitis that causes the worst red eye is called iritis, in which only the iris is inflamed. Other potential causes of eye redness include: Colds or allergies. Acute glaucoma : A sudden increase in eye pressure that is extremely painful and causes serious visual problems. This is a medical emergency. The more common form of glaucoma comes on gradually and is long-term (chronic). Corneal scratches: Injuries caused by sand, dust, or overuse of contact lenses. Sometimes, a bright red spot, called a subconjunctival hemorrhage, will appear on the white of the eye. This often happens after straining or coughing, which causes a broken blood vessel on the surface of the eye. Most often, there is no pain and your vision is normal. It is almost never a serious problem. It may be more common in people who are taking aspirin or blood thinners. Because the blood leaks into the conjunctiva, which is clear, you cannot wipe or rinse the blood away. Like a bruise, the red spot will change colors (usually yellow) and then go away within a week or two.",,"Try to rest your eyes if redness is due to fatigue or eye strain. No other treatment is needed. If you have eye pain or a vision problem, call your eye doctor right away.",Bloodshot eyes; Red eyes; Scleral injection; Conjunctival injection
Eyelid bump,"Most bumps on the eyelid are styes. A stye is an inflamed oil gland on the edge of your eyelid, where the eyelash meets the lid. It appears as a red, swollen bump that looks like a pimple. It is often tender to the touch.","A stye is caused by a blockage of one of the oil glands in the eyelids. This allows bacteria to grow inside the blocked gland. Styes are a lot like common acne pimples that occur elsewhere on the skin. You may have more than one stye at the same time. Styes most often develop over a few days. They may drain and heal on their own. A stye can become a chalazion , which occurs when an inflamed oil gland becomes fully blocked. If a chalazion gets large enough, it can cause trouble with your vision. Styes can be made worse by the presence of Demodex, a mite commonly found on human skin. Demodex has been identified as a cause of blepharitis. If you have blepharitis , you are more likely to get styes. Other possible common eyelid bumps include: Xanthelasma : Raised yellow patches on your eyelids that can happen with age. These are harmless, although they are sometimes a sign of high cholesterol. Papillomas: Pink or skin-colored bumps. They are harmless, but can slowly grow, affect your vision, or bother you for cosmetic reasons. If so, they can be surgically removed. Cysts: Small fluid-filled sacs that can affect your vision.","In addition to the red, swollen bump, other possible symptoms of a stye include: A gritty, scratchy sensation, as if there is a foreign body in your eye Sensitivity to light Tearing of your eye Tenderness of the eyelid",,Bump on the eyelid; Stye; Hordeolum
Eyelid drooping,Eyelid drooping is excess sagging of the upper eyelid. The edge of the upper eyelid may be lower than it should be (ptosis) or there may be excess baggy skin in the upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). Eyelid drooping is often a combination of both conditions.,"A drooping eyelid is most often due to: Weakness of the muscle that raises the eyelid Damage to the nerves that control that muscle Looseness of the skin of the upper eyelids Drooping eyelid can be: Caused by the normal aging process Present before birth The result of an injury or disease Diseases or illnesses that may lead to eyelid drooping include: Tumor around or behind the eye Diabetes Horner syndrome Myasthenia gravis Stroke Swelling in the eyelid, such as with a stye","Drooping may be present in one or both eyelids depending on the cause. The lid may cover only the upper eye, or the entire pupil may be covered. Problems with vision will often be present: At first, just a sense that the very upper field of vision is being blocked. When the drooping eyelid covers the pupil of the eye, vision may become completely blocked. Children may tip their head back to help them see under the eyelid. Tiredness and achiness around the eyes may also be present. Increased tearing despite a feeling of dry eyes may be noticed.",,Ptosis; Dermatochalasis; Blepharoptosis; Third nerve palsy - ptosis; Baggy eyelids

Eyelid twitch,An eyelid twitch is a general term for spasms of the eyelid muscles. These spasms happen without your control. The eyelid may repeatedly close (or nearly close) and reopen. This article discusses eyelid twitches in general.,"The most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, caffeine, and excessive alcohol intake. Rarely, they can be a side effect of a medicine used for migraine headaches. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people have this type of eyelid twitch once in a while and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped. You may have more severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes. This form of eyelid twitching is called blepharospasm. It lasts much longer than the more common type of eyelid twitch. It is often very uncomfortable and may cause your eyelids to close completely. Twitching can be caused by irritation of the: Surface of the eye (cornea) Membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva) Sometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be found.","Common symptoms of eyelid twitch are: Repeated uncontrollable twitching or spasms of your eyelid (most often the upper lid) Light sensitivity (sometimes, this is the cause of the twitching) Blurry vision (sometimes)",,Eyelid spasm; Eye twitch; Twitch - eyelid; Blepharospasm; Myokymia

Facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma,Facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma is the loss of controllable (voluntary) muscle movement in an infant's face due to pressure on the facial nerve just before or at the time of birth.,"A person's facial nerve is also called the seventh cranial nerve. In infants, it can be damaged just before or at the time of delivery. Most of the time, the cause is unknown. But a difficult delivery, with or without the use of an instrument called forceps, may lead to this condition. Some factors that can increase the risk of birth trauma (injury) include: Large baby size (may be seen if the mother has diabetes ) Long pregnancy or labor Most of the time, these factors do not lead to facial nerve palsy or birth trauma. Use of epidural anesthesia and medicines to induce labor and contractions indicate more difficult deliveries, which are at greater risk of complications such as nerve injury.","The most common form of facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma involves only the lower part of the facial nerve. This part controls the muscles around the lips. The muscle weakness is mainly noticeable when the infant cries. The newborn infant may have the following symptoms: Eyelid may not close on affected side Lower face (below eyes) appears uneven during crying Mouth does not move down the same way on both sides while crying No movement (paralysis) on the affected side of the face (from the forehead to the chin in severe cases) In some cases, other cranial nerves may be affected as well.",,Seventh cranial nerve palsy due to birth trauma; Facial palsy - birth trauma; Facial palsy - neonate; Facial palsy - infant
Facial paralysis,Facial paralysis means that a person is no longer able to move some or all of the muscles on one or both sides of the face.,"Facial paralysis is almost always caused by: Damage or swelling of the facial nerve, which carries signals from the brain to the muscles of the face Damage to the area of the brain that sends signals to the muscles of the face Weakness of the facial muscles that can occur in neurologic diseases such as myasthenia gravis or some myopathies and muscular dystrophies In people who are otherwise healthy, facial paralysis is often due to Bell palsy . This is a condition in which the facial nerve becomes inflamed. Stroke may cause facial paralysis that comes on rapidly. With a stroke, other muscles on one side of the body may also be involved. Facial paralysis that is due to a brain tumor usually develops slowly. Symptoms can include headaches, seizures, or hearing loss. In newborns, facial paralysis may be caused by trauma during birth. Other causes include: Infection of the brain or surrounding tissues Lyme disease Sarcoidosis Tumor that presses on the facial nerve Side effects of medicines, such as botulinum toxin",,"Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to take care of yourself at home.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy,Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a condition that causes muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue that gets worse over time.,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease due to a chromosome mutation. It appears in both men and women. It may develop in a child if either parent carries the gene for the disorder. In 10% to 30% of cases, the parents do not carry the gene. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is one of the most common forms of muscle dystrophy affecting 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 adults in the United States. It affects men and women equally.","Men often have more symptoms than women. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy mainly affects the face, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. However, it can also affect muscles around the pelvis, hips, and lower leg. Symptoms can appear soon after birth (infantile form), but often they do not appear until age 10 to 26 years. However, it is not uncommon for symptoms to appear much later in life. In some cases, symptoms never develop. Symptoms are most often mild and very slowly become worse. Muscle weakness of the face is common, and may include: Eyelid drooping Inability to whistle due to weakness of the cheek muscles Decreased facial expression due to weakness of facial muscles Depressed or angry facial expression Difficulty pronouncing words Difficulty reaching above the shoulder level Shoulder muscle weakness causes deformities such as pronounced shoulder blades (scapular winging) and sloping shoulders. The person has difficulty raising their arms because of shoulder and arm muscle weakness. Weakness of the lower legs is possible as the disorder gets worse. This interferes with ability to play sports because of decreased strength and poor balance. The weakness can be severe enough to interfere with walking. A small percentage of people use a wheelchair. Chronic pain is present in 50% to 80% of people with this type of muscular dystrophy. Hearing loss and abnormal heart rhythms may occur, but are rare.",,Landouzy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy
Factitious hyperthyroidism,Factitious hyperthyroidism is higher-than-normal thyroid hormone levels in the blood and symptoms that suggest hyperthyroidism. It occurs from taking too much thyroid hormone medicine.,"The thyroid gland produces the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In most cases of hyperthyroidism , the thyroid gland itself produces too much of these hormones. Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by taking too much thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism . This is called factitious hyperthyroidism. When this occurs because the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, it is called iatrogenic, or doctor-induced, hyperthyroidism. This is common. Sometimes this is intentional (for some people with depression or thyroid cancer), but often this happens because the dose is not adjusted based on follow-up blood tests. Factitious hyperthyroidism can also occur when someone takes too much thyroid hormone on purpose and may conceal this. This is very uncommon. These may be people: Who have mental disorders such as Munchausen syndrome Who are trying to lose weight Who are being treated for depression or infertility Children may take thyroid hormone pills accidentally.","The symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are the same as those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except that: There is no goiter .

Factor V deficiency,Factor V deficiency is a bleeding disorder that is passed down through families. It affects the ability of the blood to clot.,"When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should. Factor V deficiency is caused by a lack of factor V. When certain blood clotting factors are low or missing, your blood does not clot properly. Factor V deficiency is rare. It may be caused by: A variant factor V gene passed down through families (inherited) An antibody that interferes with normal factor V function You can develop an antibody that interferes with factor V: After giving birth After being treated with a certain type of fibrin glue After surgery With autoimmune diseases and certain cancers Sometimes the cause is unknown. The disease is similar to hemophilia , except bleeding into joints is less common.

It causes high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.,"Familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common genetic disorder that increases blood fats. It can cause early heart attacks . Diabetes , alcohol use, and hypothyroidism make the condition worse. Risk factors for being diagnosed with this condition include a family history of high cholesterol and early coronary artery disease.","In the early years, there may be no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may be due to impaired blood flow to parts of the body and include: Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age. Cramping of one or both calves when walking. Sores on the toes that do not heal. Sudden stroke -like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance. People with this condition may develop high cholesterol or triglyceride levels as teenagers. The condition may also be diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The levels remain high all during life. Those with familial combined hyperlipidemia have an increased risk of early coronary artery disease and heart attacks. They also have higher rates of obesity and are more likely to have glucose intolerance.",,Multiple lipoprotein-type hyperlipidemia
Familial dysautonomia,Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an inherited disorder that affects nerves throughout the body.,FD is passed down through families (inherited). A person must inherit a copy of the defective gene from each parent to develop the condition. FD occurs most often in people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry (Ashkenazi Jews). It is caused by a change (mutation) to a gene. It is rare in the general population.,"FD affects the nerves in the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. These nerves manage daily body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, digestion, and the senses. Symptoms of FD are present at birth and may grow worse over time. Symptoms vary, and may include: Swallowing problems in infants, resulting in aspiration pneumonia or poor growth Breath-holding spells, resulting in fainting Constipation or diarrhea Inability to feel pain and changes in temperature (can lead to injuries) Dry eyes and lack of tears when crying Poor coordination and unsteady walk Seizures Unusually smooth, pale tongue surface and lack of taste buds and decrease in sense of taste After age 3, most children develop autonomic crises.

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia,Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is a disorder passed down through families. It causes high amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.,"A genetic variant causes this condition. The variant results in the buildup of large lipoprotein particles that contain both cholesterol and a type of fat called triglycerides. The disease is linked to variants in the gene for apolipoprotein E. Hypothyroidism , obesity , or diabetes can make the condition worse. Risk factors for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia include a family history of the disorder or coronary artery disease.","Symptoms may not be seen until age 20 or older. Yellow deposits of fatty material in the skin called xanthomas may appear on the eyelids, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or on the tendons of the ankles, knees and elbows. Other symptoms may include: Chest pain (angina) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age Cramping of one or both calves when walking Sores on the toes that do not heal Sudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance",,Type III hyperlipoproteinemia; Deficient or defective apolipoprotein E
Familial hypercholesterolemia,Familial hypercholesterolemia is a disorder that is passed down through families. It causes LDL (bad) cholesterol level to be very high. The condition begins at birth and can cause heart attacks at an early age.,"Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder. It is caused by a gene variant on chromosome 19. The defect makes the body unable to remove low density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol from the blood. This results in a high level of LDL in the blood. This makes you more likely to have narrowing of the arteries from atherosclerosis at an early age. The condition is typically passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to inherit the disease. In rare cases, a child may inherit the gene from both parents. When this occurs, the increase in cholesterol level is much more severe. The risk for heart attacks and heart disease are high, even in childhood.","In the early years there may be no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include: Fatty skin deposits called xanthomas over parts of the hands, elbows, knees, ankles and around the cornea of the eye Cholesterol deposits in the eyelids (xanthelasmas) Chest pain ( angina ) or other signs of coronary artery disease may be present at a young age Cramping of one or both calves when walking Sores on the toes that do not heal Sudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance",,Type II hyperlipoproteinemia; Hypercholesterolemic xanthomatosis; Low density lipoprotein receptor mutation
Familial hypertriglyceridemia,Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a common disorder passed down through families. It causes a higher-than-normal level of triglycerides (a type of fat) in a person's blood.,"Familial hypertriglyceridemia is most likely caused by genetic variants combined with environmental factors. As a result, the condition clusters in families. How severe the disorder is can vary based on sex, age, hormone use, and dietary factors. People with this condition also have high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are often low. In most cases, familial hypertriglyceridemia is not noticeable until puberty or early adulthood. Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often present as well. These factors may cause even higher triglyceride levels. Alcohol, a diet high in carbohydrates, and estrogen use can make the condition worse. You are more likely to have this condition if you have a family history of hypertriglyceridemia or heart disease before age 50.",You may not notice any symptoms. Some people with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.,,Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia
Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency,Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a group of rare genetic disorders in which a person lacks a protein needed to break down fat molecules. The disorder causes a large amount of fat to build up in the blood.,"Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by a defective gene that is passed down through families. People with this condition lack an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down fat from digested food. Fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. Risk factors include a family history of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. The condition usually first develops during infancy or childhood.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Abdominal pain (may appear as colic in infants) Loss of appetite Nausea, vomiting Pain in the muscles and bones Enlarged liver and spleen Failure to thrive in infants Fatty deposits in the skin ( xanthomas ) High triglyceride levels in the blood Pale retinas and white-colored blood vessels in the retinas Chronic inflammation of the pancreas Yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)",,Type I hyperlipoproteinemia; Familial chylomicronemia; Familial LPL deficiency
Familial Mediterranean fever,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare disorder that may be passed down through families (inherited). It involves repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or joints.","FMF is most often caused by a variation in a gene named MEFV . This gene creates a protein involved in regulating inflammation. The disease usually appears only in people who received two copies of the variant gene, one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance or an autosomal recessive condition. FMF most often affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. These include non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. People from other ethnic groups can also be affected.","Symptoms usually begin between ages 5 and 15. Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms. People are usually symptom-free between attacks.

Fanconi anemia,Fanconi anemia is a rare disease passed down through families (inherited) that mainly affects the bone marrow. It results in decreased production of all types of blood cells.,"Fanconi anemia is due to an abnormal gene that damages cells, which keeps them from repairing damaged DNA. To inherit Fanconi anemia, a person must get one copy of the abnormal gene from each parent. The condition is most often diagnosed in children between 3 and 14 years old.","People with Fanconi anemia have lower-than-normal numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (cells that help the blood clot). Too few white blood cells can lead to infections. A lack of red blood cells may result in fatigue ( anemia ). A lower-than-normal amount of platelets may lead to excess bleeding. Most people with Fanconi anemia have some of these symptoms: Abnormal heart, lungs, and digestive tract Bone problems (especially the hips, spine or ribs) can cause a curved spine ( scoliosis ) Changes in the color of the skin, such as darkened areas of the skin, called café au lait spots, and vitiligo Deafness due to abnormal ears Eye or eyelid problems Kidneys that did not form correctly Problems with the arms and hands, such as missing, extra or misshapen thumbs, problems of the hands and the bone in the lower arm, and small or missing bone in the forearm Short height Small head Small testicles and genital changes Other possible symptoms: Failure to thrive Learning disability Low birth weight Intellectual disability",,Fanconi's anemia; Anemia - Fanconi's
Fanconi syndrome,Fanconi syndrome is a disorder of the kidney tubes in which certain substances normally absorbed into the bloodstream by the kidneys are released into the urine instead.,"Fanconi syndrome can be caused by faulty genes, or it may result later in life due to kidney damage. Sometimes the cause of Fanconi syndrome is unknown. Common causes of Fanconi syndrome in children are genetic variations that affect the body's ability to break down certain compounds such as: Cystine (cystinosis) Fructose ( fructose intolerance ) Galactose ( galactosemia ) Glycogen (glycogen storage disease) Cystinosis is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in children. Other causes in children include: Exposure to heavy metals such as lead, mercury, or cadmium Lowe syndrome, a rare genetic disorder of the eyes, brain, and kidneys Wilson disease Dent disease, a rare genetic disorder of the kidneys In adults, Fanconi syndrome can be caused by various things that damage the kidneys, including: Certain medicines, including azathioprine, cidofovir, gentamicin, and tetracycline Kidney transplant Light chain deposition disease Multiple myeloma Primary amyloidosis","Symptoms include: Passing large amounts of urine, which can lead to dehydration Excessive thirst Severe bone pain Fractures due to bone weakness Muscle weakness",,De Toni-Fanconi-Debré syndrome
Farsightedness,Farsightedness is having a harder time seeing objects that are close than things that are far away.,"Farsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak. It can also be a combination of both. Farsightedness is often present from birth. However, children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to correct the vision. If you have family members who are farsighted, you are also more likely to become farsighted. Watch this video about: Seeing","Symptoms include: Aching eyes Blurred vision when looking at close objects Crossed eyes (strabismus) in some children Eye strain Headache while reading Mild farsightedness may not cause any problems.

Fatigue,"Fatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy.","There are many possible causes of fatigue, including: Anemia (including iron deficiency anemia ) Depression or grief Iron deficiency (without anemia) Medicines, such as sedatives or antidepressants Persistent pain Sleep disorders such as insomnia , obstructive sleep apnea , or narcolepsy Thyroid gland that is underactive or overactive Use of alcohol or drugs, such as cocaine or narcotics, especially with regular use Fatigue can also occur with the following illnesses: Addison disease (a disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands don't produce enough hormones) Anorexia or other eating disorders Arthritis, mainly adult or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus Cancer COVID-19 Diabetes Fibromyalgia Heart failure Infection, especially one that takes a long time to recover from or treat, such as bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart muscle or valves), parasitic infections, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis , and mononucleosis Kidney disease Liver disease Malnutrition Certain medicines may also cause drowsiness or fatigue, including antihistamines for allergies, blood pressure medicines, sleeping pills, steroids, and diuretics (water pills). Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition in which symptoms of fatigue persist for at least 6 months and do not resolve with rest. The fatigue may be worsened with physical activity or mental stress. It is diagnosed based on the presence of a specific group of symptoms and after all other possible causes of fatigue are ruled out.",,"Here are some tips for reducing fatigue: Get enough sleep each night. Make sure your diet is healthy and well-balanced, and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Exercise regularly. Learn better ways to relax. Try yoga or meditation. Maintain a reasonable work and personal schedule. Change or reduce your stressors, if possible. For example, if you are able, take a vacation or resolve relationship problems. Discuss with your provider whether any supplemental vitamins might help you. Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and drug use. If you have long-term (chronic) pain or depression, treating it often helps the fatigue. Be aware that some antidepressant medicines may cause or worsen fatigue. If your medicnie is one of these, your provider may have to adjust the dosage or switch you to another medicine. DO NOT stop or change any medicines without first talking to your provider. Stimulants (including caffeine) are not effective treatments for fatigue. They can make the problem worse when they are stopped.

Febrile seizures,A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever.,"A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or above may cause febrile seizures in children. A febrile seizure can be frightening for any parent or caregiver. Most of the time, a febrile seizure does not cause any harm. The child usually does not have a more serious long-term health problem. Febrile seizures occur most often in otherwise healthy children between ages 6 months and 5 years. Toddlers are most commonly affected. Febrile seizures often run in families. Most febrile seizures occur in the first 24 hours of an illness. It may not occur when the fever is highest. A cold or viral illness may trigger a febrile seizure.","A febrile seizure may be as mild as the child's eyes rolling or limbs stiffening. A simple febrile seizure stops by itself within a few seconds to 10 minutes. It is often followed by a brief period of drowsiness or confusion. Symptoms may include any of the following: Sudden tightening (contraction) of muscles on both sides of a child's body. The muscle tightening may last for several seconds or longer. The child may cry or moan. If standing, the child will fall. The child may vomit or bite their tongue. Sometimes, children do not breathe and may begin to turn blue. The child's body may then begin to jerk rhythmically. The child will not respond to the parent's voice. Urine may be passed. A seizure lasting longer than 15 minutes, is in just one part of the body, or that occurs again during the same illness is not a normal febrile seizure. The health care provider may diagnose febrile seizure if the child has a tonic-clonic seizure but does not have a history of seizure disorders (epilepsy). A tonic-clonic seizure involves the entire body. In infants and young children, it is important to rule out other causes of a first-time seizure, especially meningitis (bacterial infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord).",,Seizure - fever induced; Febrile convulsions

Female pattern baldness,Female pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in women.,"Each strand of hair sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle. In general, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair. The reason for female pattern baldness is not well understood, but may be related to: Aging Changes in the levels of androgens (hormones that can stimulate male features) Family history of male or female pattern baldness Heavy loss of blood during menstrual periods Certain medicines, such as estrogenic oral contraceptives","Hair thinning is different from that of male pattern baldness. In female pattern baldness: Hair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp. It usually starts with a widening through the center hair part. This pattern of hair loss is known as Christmas tree pattern. The front hairline remains unaffected except for normal recession, which happens to everyone as time passes. The hair loss rarely progresses to total or near total baldness, as it may in men. If the cause is increased androgens, hair on the head is thinner while hair on the face is coarser.

Femoral nerve dysfunction,Femoral nerve dysfunction is a loss of movement or sensation in parts of the legs due to damage to the femoral nerve.,"The femoral nerve is located in the pelvis and goes down the front of the leg. It helps the muscles move the hip and straighten the leg. It provides feeling (sensation) to the front of the thigh and part of the lower leg. A nerve is made up of many fibers, called axons, surrounded by insulation, called the myelin sheath. Damage to any one nerve, such as the femoral nerve, is called mononeuropathy . Mononeuropathy is usually due to a local cause of damage to a single nerve. Disorders that involve the entire body ( systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage to one nerve at a time (such as occurs with mononeuritis multiplex ). More common causes of femoral nerve dysfunction are: Direct injury (trauma) Prolonged pressure on the nerve Compression, stretching, or entrapment of the nerve by nearby parts of the body or disease-related structures (such as a tumor or abnormal blood vessel) The femoral nerve can also be damaged from any of the following: A broken pelvis bone A catheter placed into the femoral artery in the groin Diabetes or other causes of peripheral neuropathy Internal bleeding in the pelvis or belly area (abdomen) Lying on the back with the thighs and legs flexed and turned (lithotomy position) during surgery or diagnostic procedures Tight or heavy waist belts","Symptoms may include any of the following: Sensation changes in the thigh, knee, or leg, such as decreased sensation, numbness , tingling, burning, or pain Weakness of the knee or leg, including difficulty going up and down stairs -- especially down, with a feeling of the knee giving way or buckling",,Neuropathy - femoral nerve; Femoral neuropathy

Fever,Fever is the temporary increase in the body's temperature in response to a disease or illness.,"Almost any infection can cause a fever, including: Bone infections ( osteomyelitis ), appendicitis , skin infections or cellulitis , and meningitis Respiratory infections such as colds or flu -like illnesses, sore throats , ear infections , sinus infections , mononucleosis , bronchitis , pneumonia , and tuberculosis Urinary tract infections Viral gastroenteritis and bacterial gastroenteritis Children and adults may have a low-grade fever for 1 or 2 days after some immunizations . Teething may cause a slight increase in a child's temperature, but not higher than 100°F (37.8°C). Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers. Some examples are: Arthritis or connective tissue illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease Vasculitis or periarteritis nodosa The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever. This is particularly true of Hodgkin disease , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and leukemia . Other possible causes of fever include: Blood clots or thrombophlebitis Medicines, such as some antibiotics, antihistamines, and seizure medicines",,"A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102°F to 104°F or 38.9°C to 40°C). This does not mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections don't cause a fever or can cause a very low body temperature, most often in infants. If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest. The illness is probably not serious if your child: Is still interested in playing Is eating and drinking well Is alert and smiling at you Has a normal skin color Looks well when their temperature comes down Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever. When trying to lower a fever: Do not bundle up someone who has chills. Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help. A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up. Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine. Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you to. Know how much you or your child weighs. Then check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose. In children 3 months or younger, call your child's provider first before giving medicines. Eating and drinking: Everyone, particularly children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, ice pops, soup, and gelatin are all good choices. In younger children do not give too much fruit juice or apple juice, and do not give sports drinks. Although eating is fine, do not force foods.",Elevated temperature; Hyperthermia; Pyrexia; Febrile

develop in one or both breasts. It is thought that hormones made in the ovaries
during menstruation can trigger these breast changes. This may make your
breasts feel swollen, lumpy, or painful before or during your period each
month. More than half of women
have this condition at some time during their life. It is most common between
the ages of 30 and 50. It is rare in women after menopause unless they are
taking estrogen. Fibrocystic breast changes do not change your risk for breast
cancer.","Symptoms are more often worse right before your menstrual period. They tend to get better after your period starts. If you have heavy, irregular periods, your symptoms may be worse. If you take birth control pills, you may have fewer symptoms. In most cases, symptoms get better after menopause. Symptoms may include: Pain or discomfort in both breasts that may come and go with your period, but may last through the whole month Breasts that feel full, swollen, or heavy Pain or discomfort under the arms Breast lumps that change in size with the menstrual period You may have a lump in the same area of the breast that becomes larger before each period and returns to its original size afterward. This type of lump moves when it is pushed with your fingers. It does not feel stuck or fixed to the tissue around it. This type of lump is common with fibrocystic breasts.",,Fibrocystic breast disease; Mammary dysplasia; Diffuse cystic mastopathy; Benign breast disease; Glandular breast changes; Cystic changes; Chronic cystic mastitis; Breast lump - fibrocystic; Fibrocystic breast changes
Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is a condition in which a person has long-term pain that is spread throughout their body. The pain is most often accompanied by fatigue, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, headaches, depression, and anxiety.","The cause of fibromyalgia is not known. Researchers think that it is due to a problem with how the central nervous system processes pain signals from nerves. Possible causes or triggers of fibromyalgia include: Physical or emotional trauma. Abnormal pain response: Areas in the brain that control pain may react differently in people with fibromyalgia. Sleep disturbances. Infection, such as a virus, although none has been identified. Fibromyalgia is more common in females as compared to males. Women ages 20 to 50 are the most affected group of people. The following conditions may be seen with fibromyalgia or have similar symptoms: Long-term (chronic) neck or back pain Long-term (chronic) fatigue syndrome Depression Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) Lyme disease Sleep disorders","Widespread pain is the main symptom of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia appears to be on one end of a range of chronic widespread pain, which may be present in 10% to 15% of the general population. Fibromyalgia falls on the far end of that pain severity and chronicity scale and occurs in 1% to 5% of the general population. The central feature of fibromyalgia is chronic pain in multiple sites. These sites are the head, each arm, the chest, the abdomen, each leg, the upper back and spine, and the lower back and spine (including the buttocks). The pain may be mild to severe. It may feel like a deep ache, or a stabbing, burning pain. It may feel like it is coming from the joints, although the joints are not affected or damaged and appear normal. People with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body pain and stiffness. For some people, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some people have pain all day long. Pain may get worse with: Physical activity Cold or damp weather Anxiety and stress Most people with fibromyalgia have at least one of these symptoms: fatigue, depressed mood, or sleep problems. Many people say that they cannot get to sleep or stay asleep, and they feel tired when they wake up (called non-restorative sleep). Other symptoms in people with fibromyalgia may include: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Memory and concentration problems Numbness and tingling in hands and feet Reduced ability to exercise Tension or migraine headaches",,Fibromyositis; FM; Fibrositis
Fibrous dysplasia,Fibrous dysplasia is a bone disease that destroys and replaces normal bone with fibrous bone tissue. One or more bones can be affected.,Fibrous dysplasia usually occurs in childhood. Most people have symptoms by the time they are 30 years old. The disease occurs more often in females.

Compartment syndrome , which is severe swelling and pressure in an area of muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. A crushing injury can cause this serious condition, which requires immediate medical attention. Mallet finger , when you can't straighten your finger. Sports injuries are a common cause. Finger strains , sprains , and bruises . Broken finger bones . Skier's thumb , an injury to the ligaments in your thumb, such as from a fall during skiing. Cuts and puncture wounds . Dislocation . Certain conditions can also cause finger pain: Arthritis , the breakdown of cartilage in the joint that causes inflammation with pain, stiffness, and swelling. Carpal tunnel syndrome , pressure on the median nerve in the wrist, causing numbness and pain in the hand and fingers. Raynaud phenomenon , a condition that results in blocked blood flow to the fingers when it is cold. Trigger finger , when a swollen finger tendon makes it hard to straighten or bend your finger. Dupuytrens contracture , which causes tissue in the palm of the hand to become tighter. This makes it hard to straighten the fingers. It usually affects the small or ring finger. De Quervain tenosynovitis, which causes pain in the tendons along the thumb side of the wrist, most often from overuse. Infections. Tumors.",,"Often, care at home is enough to relieve finger pain. Start by avoiding activities that cause finger pain. If finger pain is due to a minor injury: Remove any rings in case of swelling. Rest the finger joints so they can heal. Apply ice and elevate the finger. Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) to reduce both pain and swelling. If needed, buddy tape the injured finger to the one next to it. This will help protect the injured finger as it heals. Don't tape it too tight, which can cut off circulation. If you have a lot of swelling or the swelling does not go away in a day or so, see your health care provider. Small fractures or tendon or ligament tears can occur, and can lead to problems in the future if not treated correctly.

Fish tapeworm infection,Fish tapeworm infection is an intestinal infection with a parasite found in fish.,"The fish tapeworm ( Diphyllobothrium latum ) is the largest parasite that infects humans. Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain fish tapeworm cysts. The infection is seen in many areas where humans eat uncooked or undercooked freshwater fish from rivers or lakes, including: Africa Eastern Europe North and South America Scandinavia Some Asian countries After a person has eaten infected fish, the worm larva begins to grow in the intestine. Larvae are fully grown in 3 to 6 weeks. The adult worm, which is segmented, attaches to the wall of the intestine. The tapeworm may reach a length of 30 feet (9 meters). Eggs are formed in each segment of the worm and are passed in the stool. Sometimes, parts of the worm may also be passed in the stool. The tapeworm absorbs the nutrition from food that the infected person eats. This may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia.","Most people who are infected have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include: Abdominal discomfort or pain Diarrhea Weakness Weight loss",,Diphyllobothriasis

Flat feet,Flat feet (pes planus) refer to a change in foot shape in which the foot does not have a normal arch when standing.,"Flat feet are a common condition. The condition is normal in infants and toddlers. Flat feet occur because the tissues holding the joints in the foot together (called tendons) are loose. The tissues tighten and form an arch as children grow older. This will take place by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old. Most people have normal arches by the time they are adults. However, the arch may never form in some people. Some hereditary conditions cause loose tendons and ligaments. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Marfan Syndrome People born with these conditions may have flat feet. Aging, injuries, or illness may harm the tendons and cause flat feet to develop in a person who has already formed arches. This type of flat foot may occur only on one side. Rarely, painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition in which two or more of the bones in the foot grow or fuse together. This condition is called tarsal coalition.","Most flat feet do not cause pain or other problems. Children don't often have foot pain, ankle pain, or lower leg pain. They should be evaluated by a health care provider if this occurs. Symptoms in adults may include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing or playing sports.

Flu,"The flu (influenza) is a viral respiratory illness that causes fever, chills, runny nose, body aches, and cough. It spreads easily from person to person. The flu can cause moderate to severe symptoms. Most people recover fully. Children, older adults, and people with certain health conditions are at risk for severe illness and even death.","The flu is caused by an influenza virus. Most people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu. You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. People often confuse colds , flu, and COVID-19 . They are different, but they do have some of the same symptoms. Most people get a cold several times a year. In contrast, people generally get the flu only once every few years. Cold symptoms tend to be more mild compared to the flu and COVID-19. The flu and COVID-19 share many symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. The best way to know is to get tested. COVID-19 self-tests are available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. If needed, your health care provider can test you for the flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections. The flu spreads easily. It can affect a large group of people in a very short amount of time. For example, students and co-workers often get sick within 2 or 3 weeks of the flu's arrival in a school or workplace. Sometimes, you can get a virus that makes you throw up or have diarrhea. Some people call this the "" stomach flu ."" This is a misleading name because this virus is usually not the actual flu. The flu mostly affects your nose, throat, and lungs. While certain people are at a higher risk, anyone at any age can develop serious complications from the flu. Those at highest risk include: People age 65 and older Children younger than 5 years old Women who are more than 3 months pregnant Anyone living in a long-term care facility Anyone with chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions, diabetes, or a weakened immune system People with severe obesity (BMI of 40 or higher)","Flu symptoms often start quickly. You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time, symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days. The first symptom is often a fever between 100°F (37.8°C) and 104°F (40°C) that comes on suddenly. An adult often has a lower fever than a child. But not everyone with the flu has a fever. Other common symptoms include: Body aches Chills Headache Lack of energy Cough Runny or stuffy nose Sneezing Sore throat Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children) Fever usually goes away in 3 to 4 days but may last up to 8 days.

Fluid imbalance,"Every part of your body needs water to function. When you are healthy, your body is able to balance the amount of water that enters or leaves your body.","Your body is constantly losing water through breathing, sweating, and urinating. If you do not take in enough fluids or water, you become dehydrated . Your body may also have a hard time getting rid of fluids. As a result, excess fluid builds up in the body. This is called fluid overload (volume overload). This can lead to edema (excess fluid in the skin and tissues). Many medical problems can cause fluid imbalance: After surgery, the body often retains large amounts of fluid for several days, causing swelling of the body. In people with heart failure , fluid collects in the lungs, liver, blood vessels, and body tissues because the heart does a poor job of pumping it to the kidneys. When the kidneys do not work well because of long-term (chronic) kidney disease , the body cannot get rid of unneeded fluids. The body may lose too much fluid due to diarrhea , vomiting, severe blood loss, or high fever. Lack of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) can cause the kidneys to get rid of too much fluid. This results in extreme thirst, dehydration, and chemical imbalance of the blood. Often, in people with fluid imbalance, a high or low blood level of sodium or potassium is present as well. Medicines can also affect fluid balance. The most common are water pills (diuretics) to treat blood pressure, heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease.",,,Water imbalance; Fluid imbalance - dehydration; Fluid buildup; Fluid overload; Volume overload; Loss of fluids; Edema - fluid imbalance; Hyponatremia - fluid imbalance; Hypernatremia - fluid imbalance; Hypokalemia - fluid imbalance; Hyperkalemia - fluid imbalance

Focal seizure,"All seizures are caused by abnormal electrical disturbances in the brain. Focal seizures occur when this electrical activity is in a limited area of the brain. Sometimes the seizures stay only in one part of the brain, while at other times, the seizures can turn into bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, which affect the whole brain. This is called secondary generalization.","Focal seizures are the most common type of seizure in people 1 year and older. In people older than 65 who have blood vessel disease of the brain or brain tumors, focal seizures are very common. Focal seizures are usually associated with an area of the brain in which nerve cells are easily excitable. This is often due to brain injury that can result from conditions such as stroke, infection, trauma, or from problems present at birth.","People with focal, awareness impaired seizures may or may not remember any or all of the symptoms or events during the seizure.

Folate deficiency,"Folate deficiency means you have a lower-than-normal amount of folic acid, a type of vitamin B, in your blood.","Folic acid (vitamin B9) works with vitamin B12 and vitamin C to help the body break down, use, and make new proteins. The vitamin helps form red and white blood cells. It also helps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information. Folic acid is a water-soluble type of vitamin B. This means it is not stored in the fat tissues of the body. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Because folate is not stored in the body in large amounts, your blood levels will get low after only a few weeks of eating a diet low in folate. Folate is found primarily in legumes, leafy greens, eggs, beets, bananas, citrus fruits, and liver. Contributors to folate deficiency include: Diseases in which folic acid is not well absorbed in the digestive system (such as celiac disease or Crohn disease ) Drinking too much alcohol Eating overcooked fruits and vegetables. Folic acid can be easily destroyed by heat. Hemolytic anemia Certain medicines (such as phenytoin, sulfasalazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) Eating a diet that does not include enough fruits and vegetables Kidney dialysis","Folic acid deficiency may cause: Fatigue, irritability, or diarrhea Poor growth Smooth and tender tongue",,Deficiency - folic acid; Folic acid deficiency
Folate-deficiency anemia,Folate-deficiency anemia is a decrease in red blood cells (anemia) due to a lack of folate. Folate is a type of B vitamin. It is also called folic acid.,"Folate (folic acid) is needed for red blood cells to form and grow. You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver. However, your body does not store folate in large amounts. So, you need to eat plenty of folate-rich foods to maintain normal levels of this vitamin. In folate-deficiency anemia, the red blood cells are abnormally large. Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow. That is why this anemia is also called a type of megaloblastic anemia. Causes of this type of anemia include: Too little folic acid in your diet Hemolytic anemia Long-term alcoholism Use of certain medicines (such as phenytoin [Dilantin], methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates) The following raise your risk for this type of anemia: Alcoholism Eating overcooked food Poor diet (often seen in the poor, the older people, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables) Pregnancy Weight loss diets Folic acid is needed to help a baby in the womb grow properly. Too little folic acid during pregnancy may lead to birth defects in a baby.",Symptoms may include: Fatigue Weakness Headache Pallor Sore mouth and tongue,,

Barber's itch is a staph infection of the hair follicles in the beard area, usually the upper lip. Shaving makes it worse. Tinea barbae is similar to barber's itch, but the infection is caused by a fungus. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a disorder that occurs mainly in African American men. If curly beard hairs are cut too short, they may curve back into the skin and cause inflammation.

Food allergy,"A food allergy is a type of immune response triggered by eggs, peanuts, milk, shellfish or some other specific food.","Many people have a food intolerance. This term usually refers to heartburn, cramps, belly pain , or diarrhea that can occur after they eat foods such as: Corn products Cow's milk and dairy products (usually due to lactose intolerance ) Wheat and other grains that contain gluten (gluten intolerance or celiac disease ) A true food allergy is much less common. The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens . These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem. In a person with a food allergy, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. Any food can cause an allergic reaction. The most common food allergies are to: Eggs (mostly in children) Fish (older children and adults) Milk (people of all ages) Peanuts (people of all ages) Shellfish such as shrimp, crab, and lobster (people of all ages) Soy (mostly in children) Tree nuts (people of all ages) Wheat (people of all ages) In rare cases, food additives, such as dyes, thickeners, or preservatives can cause a food allergy or intolerance reaction. Some people have an oral allergy. This is an allergy type syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue after they eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables: Melons, apples, pineapple, and other foods contain substances that are similar to certain pollens. The reaction most often occurs when you eat the raw form of the foods. How severe the reaction is depends on how much of the food you eat.

Foot drop can be caused by a number of health conditions. The most common cause of foot drop is peroneal nerve injury . This nerve is also called the fibular nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot, and toes. Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles in the body can lead to foot drop. They include: Peripheral neuropathy -- Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a common inherited peripheral neuropathy. Some muscle diseases cause foot drop, including some forms of muscular dystrophy . Polio is caused by a virus, and can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. Crossing the legs at the knees can also damage the peroneal nerve. Brain and spinal cord disorders can cause muscle weakness and paralysis and include: Stroke Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Multiple sclerosis","Foot drop can cause problems walking. Because you can't raise the front of your foot, you need to raise your leg higher than normal to take a step to avoid dragging your toes or tripping.

Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer. Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles. Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia , a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and significant swelling. Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure , kidney failure , or liver failure . In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body, and it collects in the legs.

Fragile X syndrome,Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition involving changes in a gene on the X chromosome. It is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability in boys.,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by a change in a gene called FMR1 . A small part of the gene code is repeated several times in one area of the X chromosome. The more repeats (also called gene expansion), the more likely the condition will occur. The FMR1 gene makes a protein needed for your brain to function properly. A defect in the gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all. Boys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X expansion is likely to affect them more severely. You can have fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it. A family history of fragile X syndrome, developmental problems, or intellectual disability may not be present.","Behavior problems associated with fragile X syndrome include: Autism spectrum disorder Delay in crawling, walking, or twisting Hand flapping or hand biting Hyperactive or impulsive behavior Intellectual disability Speech and language delay Tendency to avoid eye contact Physical signs may include: Flat feet Flexible joints and low muscle tone Large body size Large forehead or ears with a prominent jaw Long face Soft skin Some of these problems are present at birth, while others may not develop until after puberty.

Friedreich ataxia,Friedreich ataxia is a rare disease passed down through families (inherited). It affects the muscles and heart.,"Friedreich ataxia is caused by a defect in a gene called frataxin (FXN). Changes in this gene cause the body to make too much of a part of DNA called trinucleotide repeat (GAA). Normally, the body contains about 8 to 30 copies of GAA. People with Friedreich ataxia have as many as 1,000 copies. The more copies of GAA a person has, the earlier in life the disease starts and the faster it gets worse. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means you must get a copy of the defective gene from both your mother and father.","Symptoms are caused by the wearing away of structures in areas of the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions. Symptoms most often begin before puberty. Symptoms may include: Abnormal speech Changes in vision, particularly color vision Decrease in ability to feel vibrations in lower limbs Foot problems, such as hammer toe and high arches Hearing loss, this occurs in about 10% of people Jerky eye movements Loss of coordination and balance, which leads to frequent falls Muscle weakness No reflexes in the legs Unsteady gait and uncoordinated movements ( ataxia ), which gets worse with time Muscle problems lead to changes in the spine.

Frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare form of dementia that is similar to Alzheimer disease, except that it tends to affect only certain areas of the brain.","People with FTD have abnormal substances (called tangles, Pick bodies, Pick cells, and tau proteins) inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain. The exact cause of the abnormal substances is unknown. Many different abnormal genes have been found that can cause FTD. Some cases of FTD are passed down through families. FTD is rare. It can occur in people as young as 20. But it usually begins between ages 40 and 60. The average age at which it begins is 54.","The disease gets worse slowly. Tissues in parts of the brain shrink over time. Symptoms such as behavior changes, speech difficulty, and problems with thinking occur slowly and get worse. Early personality changes can help health care providers tell FTD apart from Alzheimer disease. (Memory loss is often the main, and earliest, symptom of Alzheimer disease.) People with FTD tend to behave the wrong way in different social settings. The changes in behavior continue to get worse and are often one of the most disturbing symptoms of the disease. Some persons have more difficulty with decision-making, complex tasks, or language (trouble finding or understanding words or writing). There are variations of FTD seen with other nervous system problems such as: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig disease) Primary progressive aphasia Progressive supranuclear palsy General symptoms include: BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Not able to keep a job Compulsive behaviors Impulsive or inappropriate behavior Inability to function or interact in social or personal situations Problems with personal hygiene Repetitive behavior Withdrawal from social interaction EMOTIONAL CHANGES Abrupt mood changes Decreased interest in daily living activities Failure to recognize changes in behavior Failure to show emotional warmth, concern, empathy, sympathy Inappropriate mood Not caring about events or environment LANGUAGE CHANGES Cannot speak (mutism) Decreased ability to read or write Difficulty finding a word Difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia) Repeating anything spoken to them (echolalia) Shrinking vocabulary Weak, uncoordinated speech sounds NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS Increased muscle tone (rigidity) Memory loss that gets worse Movement/coordination difficulties (apraxia) Weakness OTHER PROBLEMS Urinary incontinence",,Semantic dementia; Dementia - semantic; Frontotemporal dementia; FTD; Arnold Pick disease; Pick disease; 3R tauopathy; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)

Fuchs dystrophy,"Fuchs (pronounced ""fooks"") dystrophy is an eye disease in which cells lining the inner surface of the cornea slowly start to die off. The disease most often affects both eyes.","Fuchs dystrophy can be inherited, which means it can be passed down from parents to children. If either of your parents has the disease, you have a 50% chance of developing the condition. However, the condition may also occur in people without a known family history of the disease. Fuchs dystrophy is more common in women than in men. Vision problems do not appear before age 50 years in most cases. However, a health care provider may be able to see signs of the disease in affected people by their 30s or 40s. Fuchs dystrophy affects the thin layer of cells that lines the back part of the cornea. These cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a cloudy cornea . At first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed. As the disease gets worse, small blisters may form. The blisters get bigger and may eventually break. This causes eye pain . Fuchs dystrophy can also cause the shape of the cornea to change, leading to more vision problems.","Symptoms may include: Eye pain Eye sensitivity to light and glare Foggy or blurred vision , at first only in the mornings Seeing colored halos around lights Worsening vision throughout the day",,Fuchs' dystrophy; Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy; Fuchs' corneal dystrophy

A baby who cries for longer than 3 hours a day might have colic. Learn ways that you can help your baby with colic . Many common childhood illnesses can cause a child to be fussy. Most illnesses are easily treated. They include: Ear infection Teething or a toothache Cold or flu Bladder infection Stomach pain or stomach flu Headache Constipation Pinworm Poor sleep patterns Although less common, your child's fussiness may be an early sign of a more serious problem, such as: Diabetes, asthma, anemia (low blood count), or other health problem Serious infections, such as an infection in the lungs , kidneys , or around the brain Head injury that you did not see happen Hearing or speech problems Autism or abnormal brain development (if fussiness does not go away and becomes more severe) Depression or other mental health problems Pain, such as headache or stomach ache",,"Soothe your child as you would normally. Try rocking, cuddling, talking, or doing things your child finds calming. Address other factors that may be causing fussiness: Poor sleep patterns Noise or stimulation around your child (too much or too little can be a problem) Stress around the home Irregular day-to-day schedule Using your parenting skills, you should be able to calm your child and make things better. Getting your child on a regular eating, sleeping, and daily schedule can also help.",Inconsolability; Irritability
Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase blood test,"Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase is a blood test that measures the level of a substance called GALT, which helps break down milk sugars in your body. A low level of this substance causes a condition called galactosemia.",,,,Galactosemia screen; GALT; Gal-1-PUT
Galactosemia,Galactosemia is a condition in which the body is unable to use (metabolize) the simple sugar galactose.,"Galactosemia is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene that can cause galactosemia, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected with it. There are 3 forms of the disease: Galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency: Classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form Deficiency of galactose kinase (GALK) Deficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase (GALE) People with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up one half of lactose, the sugar found in milk. If an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. People with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose.",Infants with galactosemia may show symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. They may develop a serious blood infection with the bacteria E coli . Symptoms of galactosemia are: Convulsions Irritability Lethargy Poor feeding -- baby refuses to eat formula containing milk Poor weight gain Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Vomiting,,Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency; Galactokinase deficiency; Galactose-6-phosphate epimerase deficiency; GALT; GALK; GALE; Epimerase deficiency galactosemia; GALE deficiency; Galactosemia type III; UDP-galactose-4; Duarte variant

Gallstones,Gallstones are hard deposits that form inside the gallbladder. These may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.,"The cause of gallstones varies. There are two main types of gallstones: Stones made of cholesterol -- This is the most common type. Cholesterol gallstones are not related to cholesterol level in the blood. In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen. Stones made of bilirubin -- These are called pigment stones. They occur when red blood cells are destroyed and too much bilirubin is in the bile. Gallstones are more common in: Female sex Native Americans and people of Hispanic descent People over age 40 People who are overweight People with family history of gallstones The following factors also make you more likely to develop gallstones: Bone marrow or solid organ transplant Diabetes Failure of the gallbladder to empty bile properly (this is more likely to happen during pregnancy) Liver cirrhosis and biliary tract infections (pigmented stones) Medical conditions that cause too many red blood cells to be destroyed Rapid weight loss from eating a very low-calorie diet, or after weight loss surgery Receiving nutrition through a vein for a long period of time (intravenous feedings) Taking birth control pills","Many people with gallstones do not have any symptoms. These are often found during a routine x-ray, abdominal surgery, or other medical procedure. However, if a large stone blocks a tube or duct that drains the gallbladder, you may have a cramping pain in the middle to right upper abdomen. This is known as biliary colic. The pain goes away if the stone passes into the first part of the small intestine. Symptoms that may occur include: Pain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen for at least 30 minutes. The pain may be constant or cramping. It can feel sharp or dull. Fever. Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).

Ganglioneuroblastoma,"Ganglioneuroblastoma is an intermediate tumor that arises from nerve tissues. An intermediate tumor is one that is between benign (slow-growing and unlikely to spread) and malignant (fast-growing, aggressive, and likely to spread).","Ganglioneuroblastoma mostly occurs in children ages 2 to 4 years. The tumor affects boys and girls equally. It occurs rarely in adults. Tumors of the nervous system have different degrees of differentiation. This is based on how the tumor cells look under the microscope. It can predict whether or not they are likely to spread. Benign tumors are less likely to spread. Malignant tumors are aggressive, grow quickly, and often spread. A ganglioneuroma is less malignant in nature. A neuroblastoma (occurring in children over 1 year old) is usually malignant. A ganglioneuroblastoma may be only in one area or it may be widespread, but it is usually less aggressive than a neuroblastoma. The cause is unknown.","Most commonly, a lump can be felt in the abdomen with tenderness. This tumor may also occur at other sites, including: Chest cavity Neck Legs",,
Ganglioneuroma,Ganglioneuroma is a tumor of the autonomic nervous system.,"Ganglioneuromas are rare tumors that most often start in autonomic nerve cells. Autonomic nerves manage body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. The tumors are usually noncancerous ( benign ). Ganglioneuromas usually occur in people over 10 years of age. They grow slowly, and may release certain chemicals or hormones. There are no known risk factors. However, the tumors may be associated with some genetic problems, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 .","A ganglioneuroma usually causes no symptoms. The tumor is only discovered when a person is examined or treated for another condition. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and the type of chemicals it releases. If the tumor is in the chest area (mediastinum), symptoms may include: Breathing difficulty Chest pain Compression of the windpipe (trachea) If the tumor is lower down in the abdomen in the area called the retroperitoneal space, symptoms may include: Abdominal or back pain Bloating If the tumor is near the spinal cord, it may cause: Compression of the spinal cord, which leads to pain and loss of strength or feeling in the legs, arms, or both Spine deformity These tumors may produce certain hormones, which can cause the following symptoms: Diarrhea High blood pressure Increased body hair",,
Gangrene,Gangrene is the death of tissue in part of the body.,"Gangrene happens when a body part loses its blood supply. This may happen from injury, an infection, or other causes. You have a higher risk for gangrene if you have: A serious injury A blood vessel disease (such as arteriosclerosis, also called hardening of the arteries, in your arms or legs) Diabetes A suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV/AIDS or chemotherapy) Surgery","The symptoms depend on the location and cause of the gangrene. If the skin is involved, or the gangrene is close to the skin, the symptoms may include: Discoloration (blue or black if skin is affected; red or bronze if the affected area is beneath the skin) Foul-smelling discharge Loss of feeling in the area (which may happen after severe pain in the area) If the affected area is inside your body (such as gangrene of the gallbladder or gas gangrene ), the symptoms may include: Confusion Fever Gas in tissues beneath the skin General ill feeling Low blood pressure Persistent or severe pain",,
Gas –  flatulence,Gas is air in the intestine that is passed through the rectum. Air that moves from the digestive tract through the mouth is called belching.,"Gas can be caused by certain foods you eat. You may have gas if you: Eat foods that are hard to digest, such as fiber. Sometimes, adding more fiber into your diet can cause temporary gas. Your body may adjust and stop producing gas over time. Insoluble fiber (such as bran) causes more gas than soluble fiber (such as psyllium). Eat or drink something your body cannot tolerate. For example, some people have lactose intolerance and cannot eat or drink dairy products. Many people get gassy from fructose and related products. Other common causes of gas are: Antibiotics Irritable bowel syndrome Inability to absorb nutrients properly ( malabsorption ) Inability to digest nutrients properly (maldigestion) Swallowing air while eating Chewing gum Smoking cigarettes Drinking carbonated beverages Eating a lot of candy or gum with sugar substitutes Talking while eating Eating too rapidly",,"The following tips may help you prevent gas: Chew your food more thoroughly. Lower intake of beans, cabbage, onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts Avoid foods high in poorly digestible carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are called FODMAPs and include fructose (fruit sugar). Avoid lactose. Do not drink carbonated drinks. Do not chew gum or eat frequent diabetic candy with sugar substitutes Eat more slowly. Relax while you eat. Walk for 10 to 15 minutes after eating.",Flatulence; Flatus
Gas gangrene,Gas gangrene is a potentially deadly form of tissue death (gangrene).,"Gas gangrene is most often caused by bacteria called Clostridium perfringens. Also, it can occasionally be caused caused by group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio vulnificus . Clostridium is found nearly everywhere. As the bacteria grow inside the body, they emit gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels. Gas gangrene develops suddenly. It usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound. In some cases, it occurs without an irritating event. People most at risk for gas gangrene usually have blood vessel disease ( atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries), diabetes , or colon cancer .","Gas gangrene causes very painful swelling . The skin turns pale to brownish-red. When the swollen area is pressed, gas can be felt (and sometimes heard) as a crackly sensation (crepitus). The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over minutes. The area may be completely destroyed. Symptoms include: Air under the skin ( subcutaneous emphysema ) Blisters filled with brown-red fluid Drainage from the tissues, foul-smelling brown-red or bloody fluid ( serosanguineous discharge) Increased heart rate ( tachycardia ) Moderate to high fever Moderate to severe pain around a skin injury Pale skin color, later becoming dusky and changing to dark red or purple Swelling that worsens around a skin injury Sweating Vesicle formation, combining into large blisters Yellow color to the skin ( jaundice ) If the condition is not treated, the person can go into shock with decreased blood pressure ( hypotension ), kidney failure , coma, and finally death.",,Tissue infection - clostridial; Gangrene - gas; Myonecrosis; Clostridial infection of tissues; Necrotizing soft tissue infection

Gastroesophageal reflux disease,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backward from the stomach into the esophagus (food pipe). Food travels from your mouth to the stomach through your esophagus. GERD can irritate the food pipe and cause heartburn and other symptoms.,"When you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms. Harsh stomach acids can also damage the lining of the esophagus. The risk factors for reflux include: Use of alcohol (possibly) Hiatal hernia (a condition in which part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities) Obesity Pregnancy Scleroderma Smoking or tobacco use Lying down within 3 hours after eating Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux can be caused by or made worse by pregnancy. Symptoms can also be caused by certain medicines, such as: Anticholinergics (for example, sea sickness medicine) Beta-blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease Bronchodilators for asthma or other lung diseases Calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure Dopamine-active drugs for Parkinson disease Progestin for abnormal menstrual bleeding or birth control Sedatives for insomnia or anxiety Theophylline (for asthma or other lung diseases) Tricyclic antidepressants Talk to your health care provider if you think one of your medicines may be causing heartburn.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease - children,Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when the stomach contents leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach). This is also called reflux. GER can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.,"When we eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) prevents swallowed food from moving back up. When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. In infants, this ring of muscles has not fully developed, and this can allow reflux. This is why babies often spit up after feeding. Reflux in infants goes away once this muscle develops, often by age 1 year. When symptoms continue or become worse, it may be a sign of GERD. Certain factors can lead to GERD in children, including: Birth defects, such as hiatal hernia , a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. Obesity. Certain medicines, such as some medicines used for asthma. Secondhand smoke. Surgery of the upper abdomen. Brain disorders, such as cerebral palsy . Genetics -- GERD tends to run in families.","Common symptoms of GERD in children and teens include: Nausea, bringing food back up (regurgitation), or perhaps vomiting. Reflux and heartburn .

A ring of muscle fibers prevents food at the top of the stomach from moving up into the esophagus. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. If this muscle does not close well, food can leak back into the esophagus. This is called gastroesophageal reflux. A small amount of gastroesophageal reflux is normal in young infants. However, ongoing reflux with frequent vomiting can irritate the esophagus and make the infant fussy. Severe reflux that causes weight loss or breathing problems is not normal.","Symptoms may include: Cough, especially after eating Excessive crying as if in pain Excessive vomiting during the first few weeks of life; worse after eating Extremely forceful vomiting Not feeding well Refusing to eat Slow growth Weight loss Wheezing or other breathing problems",,Reflux - infants

Risk factors for gastroparesis include: Diabetes Gastrectomy (surgery to remove part of the stomach) Systemic sclerosis Use of medicine that blocks certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medicine),Symptoms may include: Abdominal distention Abdominal pain Hypoglycemia (in people with diabetes) Nausea Premature abdominal fullness after meals Weight loss without trying Vomiting,,Gastroparesis diabeticorum; Delayed gastric emptying; Diabetes - gastroparesis; Diabetic neuropathy - gastroparesis
Gastroschisis,Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant's intestines are outside of the body because of a hole in the abdominal wall.,"Babies with gastroschisis are born with a hole in the abdominal wall. The child's intestines often stick out (protrude) through the hole. The condition looks similar to an omphalocele . An omphalocele, however, is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. With gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane. Abdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestine and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries, or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with gastroschisis, the intestines (and sometimes the stomach) remain outside the abdominal wall, without a membrane covering them. The exact cause of abdominal wall defects is not known. Mothers with the following may be at higher risk of having babies with gastroschisis: Younger age Fewer resources Poor nutrition during pregnancy Use of tobacco, illicit drugs, and alcohol Exposure to nitrosamine (a chemical found in some foods, cosmetics, cigarettes) Use of aspirin or ibuprofen Use of decongestants that have the chemical pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine Babies with gastroschisis usually do not have other related birth defects.","A gastroschisis is usually seen during a prenatal ultrasound. It can also be seen when the baby is born. There is a hole in the abdominal wall. The small intestine is often outside the abdomen near the umbilical cord. Other organs that may also be outside the abdomen are the large intestine, stomach, and/or gallbladder. Usually the intestine is irritated by the exposure to amniotic fluid.

Gaucher disease,Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder in which a person lacks an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GBA).,"Gaucher disease is rare in the general population. People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease. It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that the mother and father must both pass one abnormal copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who carries an abnormal copy of the gene but doesn't have the disease is called a silent carrier. The lack of the GBA causes harmful substances to build up in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. These substances prevent cells and organs from working properly. There are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease: Type 1 is most common. It involves bone disease, anemia, an enlarged spleen and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). Type 1 affects both children and adults. It is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Type 2 usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement. This form can lead to rapid, early death. Type 3 may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems. People with this type may live into adulthood.",Bleeding because of low platelet count is the most common symptom seen in Gaucher disease. Other symptoms may include: Bone pain and fractures Cognitive impairment (decreased thinking ability) Easy bruising Enlarged spleen Enlarged liver Fatigue Heart valve problems Lung disease (rare) Seizures Severe swelling at birth Skin changes,,Glucocerebrosidase deficiency; Glucosylceramidase deficiency; Lysosomal storage disease - Gaucher; Gaucher's disease
Gender dysphoria,"Gender dysphoria is the term for a deep sense of unease and distress that may occur when your biological sex does not match your gender identity. In the past, this was called gender identity disorder. For example, you may be assigned at birth as a female gender, but you feel a deep inner sense of being male. In some people, this mismatch can cause severe discomfort, anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions.","Gender identity is how you feel and identify, and can be as a female, male, or both. Gender is typically assigned at birth, based on a baby having the outward appearance (genital organs) of either a male or a female as per a social construct of a binary system of two genders (male or female). If your gender identity matches the gender assigned to you at birth, this is called cisgender. For example, if you were born biologically as a male, and you identify as a man, you are a cisgender man. Transgender refers to identifying as a gender that is different from the biological gender assigned when you were born. For example, if were born biologically female and were assigned a female gender, but you feel a deep inner sense of being a man, you are a transgender man. Some people express their gender in ways that do not fit into traditional binary social norms of male or female gender. This is called non-binary, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, or gender-expansive. In general, most transgender people do not identify as non-binary. It is important to mention that the anxiety transgender people may feel due to having the body of the wrong gender is deeply distressing. As a result, the transgender community has a higher rate of mental health problems and risk of attempted suicide. No one knows exactly what causes gender dysphoria. Some experts believe that hormones in the womb, genes, and cultural and environmental factors may be involved.","Children and adults can experience gender dysphoria. Symptoms vary, depending upon a person's age, but most people want to live in a way that matches their gender identity. As an adult, you may have had these feelings from a young age. Children may: Insist that they are the other gender Strongly want to be the other gender Want to dress in the clothes typically used by another gender and resist wearing clothes associated with their biological gender Prefer to act the conventional roles of the other gender in play or fantasy Prefer toys and activities conventionally thought of as of the other gender Strongly prefer to play with children of the other gender Feel a strong dislike of their genitals Want to have the physical characteristics of the other gender Adults may: Strongly want to be the other gender (or a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth) Want to have the physical and sexual characteristics of the other gender Want to be rid of their own genitals Want to be treated like the other gender Want to be addressed as the other gender (pronouns) Strongly feel and react in ways associated with of the other gender The emotional pain and distress of gender dysphoria can interfere with school, work, social life, religious practice, or other areas of life.

Genital herpes,Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).,"Genital herpes affects the skin or mucous membranes of the genitals. The virus is spread from one person to another during sexual contact. There are 2 types of HSV: HSV-1 most often affects the mouth and lips and causes cold sores or fever blisters. But it can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex. HSV type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes. It can be spread through skin contact or fluids from the mouth or genitals. You may become infected with HSV if your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has HSV. You are most likely to get HSV if you touch the skin of someone who has herpes sores, blisters, or a rash. But the virus can still be spread, even when no sores or other symptoms are present. In some cases, you do not know you are infected. Genital HSV-2 infections are more common in women than men.","Many people with genital herpes never have sores. Or they have very mild symptoms that go unnoticed or are mistaken for insect bites or another skin condition. If signs and symptoms do occur during the first outbreak, they can be severe. This first outbreak most often happens within 2 days to 2 weeks of being infected. General symptoms may include: Decreased appetite Fever General sick feeling ( malaise ) Muscle aches in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, or knees Swollen and tender lymph nodes in the groin Genital symptoms include small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluid. Areas where the sores may found include: Outer vaginal lips (labia), vagina, cervix, around the anus, and on the thighs or buttocks (in women) Penis, scrotum, around the anus, on the thighs or buttocks (in men) Tongue, mouth, eyes, gums, lips, fingers, and other parts of the body (in both genders) Before the blisters appear, there may be tingling, burning, itching, or pain at the site where the blisters will appear. When the blisters break, they leave shallow ulcers that are very painful. These ulcers crust over and heal in 7 to 14 days or more. Other symptoms may include: Pain when passing urine Vaginal discharge (in women) Problems emptying the bladder that may require a urinary catheter A second outbreak can appear weeks or months later. It is most often less severe and it goes away sooner than the first outbreak.

Genital warts,"Genital warts are soft growths on the skin and mucous membranes of the genitals. They may be found on the penis, vulva, urethra, vagina, cervix, and around and in the anus.","The virus that causes genital warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are more than 180 types of HPV. Many cause no problems. Some cause warts on other parts of the body and not the genitals. Types 6 and 11 are most commonly linked to genital warts. Certain other types of HPV can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix , or to cervical cancer . These are called high-risk types of HPV. They can also lead to vaginal or vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and throat or mouth cancer. Important facts about HPV: HPV infection spreads from one person to another through sexual contact involving the anus, mouth, or vagina. The virus can be spread, even if you DO NOT see the warts. You may not see warts for 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected. You may not notice them for years. Not everyone who has come into contact with the HPV virus and genital warts will develop them. You are more likely to get genital warts and spread them more quickly if you: Have multiple sexual partners Are sexually active at an early age Use tobacco or alcohol Have a viral infection, such as herpes, and are stressed at the same time Are pregnant Have a weakened immune system due to a condition such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or from medicines If a child has genital warts, sexual abuse should be suspected as a possible cause.","Genital warts can be so tiny, you cannot see them.

Gingivitis,Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums.,"Gingivitis is an early form of periodontal disease . Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth. This can include the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and bone. Gingivitis is due to the short-term effects of plaque deposits on your teeth. Plaque is a sticky material made up of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that builds up on the teeth both above, and below the gums. It is also a major cause of tooth decay. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar (or calculus) that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. An excess of bacteria in the mouth, and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become swollen, and tender. This is called an inflammatory response, which is part of the body's natural immune response to invading organisms. These things raise your risk for gingivitis: Certain infections and body-wide (systemic) diseases Poor dental hygiene Pregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums) Uncontrolled diabetes Smoking Misaligned teeth , rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns) Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, bismuth, and some birth control pills Many people have some amount of gingivitis. It often develops during puberty or early adulthood because of hormonal changes. It may last a long time or come back often, depending on the health of your teeth and gums.","Symptoms of gingivitis include: Bleeding gums (when brushing or flossing) Bright red or reddish-purple gums Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless Mouth sores Swollen gums Shiny appearance to gums Bad breath",,Gum disease; Periodontal disease

Glanzmann thrombasthenia,Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder of blood platelets. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by the lack of a protein that is normally on the surface of platelets. This substance is needed for platelets to clump together to plug up bleeding spots and begin forming a clot. The condition is congenital, which means it is present from birth. There are several genetic abnormalities that can cause the condition.",Symptoms may include any of the following: Heavy bleeding during and after surgery Bleeding gums Bruising easily or pinpoint red spots on the skin Heavy menstrual bleeding Nosebleeds that do not stop easily Prolonged bleeding with minor injuries,,Glanzmann's disease; Thrombasthenia - Glanzmann
Glaucoma,Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.,"Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma: Open-angle glaucoma Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma Congenital glaucoma Secondary glaucoma The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that is in front of the iris, pupil, and angle. Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye. In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow. In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden. Either type can damage the optic nerve. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it. The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision. Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease. Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure. Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack. Acute closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency. If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your eye doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye. Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include: Medicines such as corticosteroids Eye diseases, such as uveitis (an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) Diseases such as diabetes Eye injury Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies. It often runs in families. It is present at birth. It is caused when the eye does not develop normally.","OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA Most people have no symptoms. Once you are aware of vision loss, the damage is already severe. Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision) is the main type of vision loss. Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness. ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice: Sudden, severe pain in one eye Decreased or cloudy vision, often called ""steamy"" vision Nausea and vomiting Rainbow-like halos around lights Red eye Eye feels swollen CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old. Cloudiness of the front of the eye Enlargement of one eye or both eyes Red eye Sensitivity to light Tearing SECONDARY GLAUCOMA Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a condition in which red blood cells break down when the body is exposed to certain medicines or the stress of infection. It is hereditary, which means it is passed down in families.","G6PD deficiency occurs when a person is missing or does not have enough of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme helps red blood cells work properly. Too little G6PD leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called hemolysis. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. The episodes are most often brief. This is because the body continues to produce new red blood cells, which have normal G6PD activity. Red blood cell destruction can be triggered by infections, certain foods (such as fava beans), and certain medicines, including: Antimalarial medicines such as quinine Aspirin (high doses) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Sulfa medicines Antibiotics such as quinolones, nitrofurantoin Other chemicals, such as those in mothballs, can also trigger an episode. In the United States, G6PD deficiency is more common among blacks than whites. Men are more likely to have this disorder than women. You are more likely to develop this condition if you: Are African American Are of Middle Eastern decent, particularly Kurdish or Sephardic Jewish Are male Have a family history of the deficiency A form of this disorder is common in whites of Mediterranean descent. This form is also associated with acute episodes of hemolysis. Episodes are longer and more severe than in the other types of the disorder.",People with this condition do not display any signs of the disease until their red blood cells are exposed to certain chemicals in food or medicine.

Sometimes, more than one joint is infected.","Symptoms of joint infection may include: Fever Joint pain for 1 to 4 days Pain in the hands or wrists due to tendon inflammation Pain or burning during urination Single joint pain Skin rash (sores are slightly raised, pink to red, and may later contain pus or appear purple)",,Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI); Disseminated gonococcemia; Septic arthritis - gonococcal arthritis
Gonorrhea,Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).,"Gonorrhea is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Any type of sex can spread gonorrhea. You can get it through contact with the mouth, throat, eyes, urethra, vagina, penis, or anus. Over one million cases occur in the United States each year. The bacteria grow in warm, moist areas of the body. This can include the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). In women, the bacteria may be found in the reproductive tract (which includes the fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix). The bacteria can also grow in the eyes. Health care providers are required by law to report all cases of gonorrhea to the local Department of Health. The goal of this law is to make sure the person gets proper follow-up care and treatment. Sexual partners also need to be found, tested, and treated. You are more likely to develop this infection if: You have multiple sex partners. You have a partner with a past history of any STI. You do not use a condom during sex. You abuse alcohol or illegal substances.","Symptoms of gonorrhea most often appear 2 to 5 days after infection. However, it may take up to a month for symptoms to appear in men. Some people do not have symptoms. They may not know that they have caught the infection, so do not seek treatment. This increases the risk of complications and the chances of passing the infection on to another person. Symptoms in men include: Burning and pain while urinating Need to urinate urgently or more often Discharge from the penis (white, yellow, or green in color) Red or swollen opening of penis (urethra) Tender or swollen testicles Sore throat (gonococcal pharyngitis) Symptoms in women can be very mild.

Gout,Gout is a type of arthritis. It occurs when uric acid builds up in the blood and causes inflammation in the joints.,"Gout is caused by having higher-than-normal level of uric acid in your body. This may occur if: Your body makes too much uric acid Your body has a hard time getting rid of uric acid When uric acid builds up in the fluid around the joints (synovial fluid), uric acid crystals form. These crystals cause the joint to become inflamed, causing pain, swelling and warmth. The exact cause is unknown. Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol. As people become older, gout becomes more common. The condition may also develop in people with: Diabetes Kidney disease Obesity Sickle cell anemia and other anemias Leukemia and other blood cancers Gout may occur after taking medicines that interfere with the removal of uric acid from the body. People who take certain medicines, such as hydrochlorothiazide and other water pills, may have a higher level of uric acid in the blood.","Symptoms of acute gout: In most cases, only one or a few joints are affected. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected. Sometimes many joints become swollen and painful. The pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often severe, described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating. The joint appears warm and red. It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it). There may be a fever . The attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer. The pain and swelling most often go away after the first attack. Many people will have another attack in the next 6 to 12 months. Some people may develop chronic gout. This is also called gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint damage and loss of motion in the joints. People with chronic gout will have joint pain and other symptoms most of the time. Deposits of uric acid can form lumps below the skin around joints or other places such as the elbows, fingertips, and ears. The lump is called a tophus, from Latin, meaning a type of stone.

Graft-versus-host disease,Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur after certain stem cell or bone marrow transplants.,"GVHD may occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in which someone receives bone marrow tissue or cells from a donor. This type of transplant is called allogeneic. The new, transplanted cells regard the recipient's body as foreign. When this happens, the cells attack the recipient's body. GVHD does not occur when people receive their own cells. This type of transplant is called autologous. Before a transplant, tissue and cells from possible donors are checked to see how closely they match the recipient. GVHD is less likely to occur, or symptoms will be milder, when the match is close. The chance of GVHD is: Around 35% to 45% when the donor and recipient are related Around 60% to 80% when the donor and recipient are not related","There are two types of GVHD: acute and chronic. Symptoms in both acute and chronic GVHD range from mild to severe. Acute GVHD usually happens within days or as late as 6 months after a transplant.

The gland is located at the front of the neck above where the collarbones meet. This gland releases the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which control body metabolism . Controlling metabolism is important for regulating mood, weight, and mental and physical energy levels. When the body makes too much thyroid hormone, the condition is called hyperthyroidism . (An underactive thyroid leads to hypothyroidism .) Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is due to an abnormal immune system response that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is most common in women over age 20. But the disorder can occur at any age and can affect men as well.","Younger people may have these symptoms: Anxiety or nervousness, as well as problems sleeping Breast enlargement in men (possible) Problems concentrating Fatigue Frequent bowel movements Hair loss Heat intolerance and increased sweating Increased appetite , despite having weight loss Irregular menstrual periods in women Muscle weakness of the hips and shoulders Moodiness, including irritability and anger Palpitations (sensation of a strong or unusual heartbeat) Rapid or irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath with activity Shaking hands ( tremors ) Weight loss Many people with Graves disease have problems with their eyes: The eyeballs may seem to be bulging out and may be painful.

Grief,Grief is a reaction to a major loss of someone or something. It is most often an unhappy and painful emotion.,"Grief may be triggered by the death of a loved one. People also can experience grief if they have an illness for which there is no cure, or a chronic condition that affects their quality of life. The end of a significant relationship may also cause grieving. Everyone feels grief in their own way. But there are common stages to the process of mourning. It starts with recognizing a loss and continues until a person eventually accepts that loss. People's responses to grief will be different, depending on the circumstances of the event. For example, if the person who died had a chronic illness, the death may have been expected. The end of the person's suffering might even have come as a relief. If the death was accidental or violent, coming to a stage of acceptance might take longer.","One way to describe grief is in five stages.

Group B streptococcal septicemia of the newborn,Group B streptococcal (GBS) septicemia is a severe bacterial infection that affects newborn infants.,"Septicemia is an infection in the bloodstream (also called bacteremia) that may travel to different body organs. GBS septicemia is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae , which is commonly called group B strep, or GBS. GBS is commonly found in adults and older children and usually does not cause infection. But it can make newborn babies very sick. There are two ways in which GBS can be passed to a newborn baby: The baby can become infected while passing through the birth canal. In this case, babies become ill between birth and 6 days of life (most often in the first 24 hours). This is called early-onset GBS disease. The infant may also become infected after delivery by coming into contact with people who carry the GBS germ. In this case, symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old. This is called late-onset GBS disease. GBS septicemia now occurs less often, because there are methods to screen and treat pregnant women whose babies are at risk. The following increase an infant's risk for GBS septicemia: Being born more than 3 weeks before the due date (prematurity), especially if the mother goes into labor early (preterm labor) and has not been screened for GBS Mother who has already given birth to a baby with GBS sepsis Mother who has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher during labor and has not been screened for GBS Mother who has GBS in her gastrointestinal, reproductive, or urinary tract Rupture of membranes (water breaks) more than 18 hours before the baby is delivered in a mother who has not been screened for GBS","The baby may have any of the following signs and symptoms: Blue appearance (cyanosis) Breathing difficulties, such as flaring of the nostrils, grunting noises, rapid breathing, and short periods without breathing Irregular or abnormal (fast or very slow) heart rate Lethargy Pale appearance (pallor) with cold skin Poor feeding Unstable body temperature (low or high)",,Group B strep; GBS; Group B streptococcal bacteremia; Neonatal sepsis - strep

With an autoimmune disorder, the body's immune system attacks itself by mistake. The incidence of GBS increases with aging, but can occur at any age. People older than 50 years are at the greatest risk. GBS may occur following infections from viruses or bacteria, such as: Influenza Some gastrointestinal illnesses Mycoplasma pneumonia HIV, the virus that causes HIV/AIDS (very rare) Herpes simplex Mononucleosis COVID-19 GBS may also occur with other medical conditions, such as: Systemic lupus erythematosus Hodgkin disease After surgery GBS damages parts of nerves. This nerve damage causes tingling, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and paralysis. GBS most often affects the nerve covering ( myelin sheath). This damage is called demyelination. It causes nerve signals to move more slowly. Damage to other parts of the nerve can cause the nerve to stop working.","Symptoms of GBS can get worse quickly. It may take only a few hours for the most severe symptoms to appear. But weakness that increases over several days is also common. Muscle weakness or loss of muscle function (paralysis) affects both sides of the body. In most cases, the muscle weakness starts in the legs and spreads to the arms. This is called ascending paralysis. If the inflammation affects the nerves of the chest and diaphragm (the large muscle under your lungs that helps you breathe) and those muscles are weak, you may need breathing assistance . Other typical signs and symptoms of GBS include: Loss of tendon reflexes in the arms and legs Tingling or numbness (mild loss of sensation) Muscle tenderness or pain (may be a cramp-like pain) Uncoordinated movement (cannot walk without help) Low blood pressure or poor blood pressure control Abnormal heart rate Other symptoms may include: Blurred vision and double vision Clumsiness and falling Difficulty moving face muscles Feeling your heart beat (palpitations) Emergency symptoms (seek medical help right away): Breathing temporarily stops Cannot take a deep breath Difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing Drooling Fainting Feeling light headed when standing",,GBS; Landry-Guillain-Barre syndrome; Acute idiopathic polyneuritis; Infectious polyneuritis; Acute inflammatory polyneuropathy; Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy; Ascending paralysis; Guillain-Barré syndrome

Male pattern baldness can occur at any time after puberty. About 80% of men show signs of male pattern baldness by age 70 years. PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL STRESS Physical or emotional stress may cause one half to three quarters of scalp hair to shed. This kind of hair loss is called telogen effluvium. Hair tends to come out in handfuls when you shampoo, comb, or run your hands through your hair. You may not notice this for weeks to months after the episode of stress. Hair shedding decreases over 6 to 8 months. Telogen effluvium is usually temporary. But it can become long-term (chronic).

Hearing loss,Hearing loss is being partly or totally unable to hear sound in one or both ears.,"Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. This may be because: Sound is not reaching the eardrum. The eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound. The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly. Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include: Buildup of wax in the ear canal Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid remaining in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal Hole in the eardrum Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the inner ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed. Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by: Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis , mumps , scarlet fever , and measles Ménière disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to: Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb, such as toxoplasmosis , rubella , or herpes The ear can also be injured by: Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum , often from scuba diving Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones",,"You can often flush wax buildup out of the ear (gently) with ear syringes (available in drug stores) and warm water.

Risk factors for infant hearing loss include: Family history of hearing loss Low birth weight Hearing loss may occur when there is a problem in the outer or middle ear. These problems may slow or prevent sound waves from passing through. They include: Birth defects that cause changes in the structure of the ear canal or middle ear Buildup of ear wax Buildup of fluid behind the eardrum Injury to or rupture of the eardrum Objects stuck in the ear canal Scar on the eardrum from many infections Another type of hearing loss is due to a problem with the inner ear. It may occur when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that move sound through the ear are damaged. This type of hearing loss can be caused by: Exposure to certain toxic chemicals or medicines while in the womb or after birth Genetic disorders Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis , measles , or herpes) Infections that can damage the brain after birth, such as meningitis or measles Problems with the structure of the inner ear Tumors Central hearing loss results from damage to the auditory nerve itself, or the brain pathways that lead to the nerve. Central hearing loss is rare in infants and children.","Signs of hearing loss in infants vary by age. For example: A newborn baby with hearing loss may not startle when there is a loud noise nearby. Older infants, who should respond to familiar voices, may show no reaction when spoken to. Children should be using single words by 15 months, and simple 2-word sentences by age 2. If they do not reach these milestones, the cause may be hearing loss. Some children may not be diagnosed with hearing loss until they are in school. This is true even if they were born with hearing loss. Inattention and falling behind in class work may be signs of undiagnosed hearing loss.",,Deafness - infants; Hearing impairment - infants; Conductive hearing loss - infants; Sensorineural hearing loss - infants; Central hearing loss - infants

Heart attack,"Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to the heart. If the blood flow is blocked, the heart is starved of oxygen and heart cells die.","A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells. A heart attack may occur when: A disruption in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack. The cause of a heart attack is not always known, but there are well known risk factors. A heart attack may occur: When you are resting or asleep After a sudden increase in physical activity When you are active outside in cold weather After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness Many risk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack .","A heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. DO NOT try to drive yourself to the hospital. DO NOT WAIT. You are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours of a heart attack. Chest pain is the most common symptom of a heart attack. You may feel the pain in only one part of your body OR Pain may move from your chest to your arms, shoulder, neck, teeth, jaw, belly area, or back The pain can be severe or mild. It can feel like: A tight band around the chest Bad indigestion Something heavy sitting on your chest Squeezing or heavy pressure The pain most often lasts longer than 20 minutes. Rest and a medicine to relax the blood vessels (called nitroglycerin) may not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack. Symptoms may also go away and come back. Other symptoms of a heart attack can include: Anxiety Cough Fainting Lightheadedness, dizziness Nausea and vomiting Palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly) Shortness of breath Sweating , which may be very heavy Some people (including older adults, people with diabetes, and women) may have little or no chest pain.

Heart failure,Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body efficiently. This causes symptoms to occur throughout the body.,"Heart failure is most often a long-term (chronic) condition, but it may come on suddenly. It can be caused by many different heart problems. The condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. Both sides of the heart also can be involved. Heart failure may be due to two different problems with the heart muscle: Your heart muscle cannot contract very well. This is called systolic heart failure, or heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Your heart muscle is stiff and does not fill up with blood easily even though pumping power is normal. This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure or, more simply, just heart failure. The most common causes of heart failure are: Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly. High blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness of the heart muscle, or eventually leading to heart muscle weakening. Other heart problems that may cause heart failure are: Congenital heart disease Heart attack (when coronary artery disease results in a sudden blockage of a heart artery) Heart valves that are leaky or narrowed Infection that weakens the heart muscle Some types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) Other diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure: Amyloidosis Emphysema Overactive thyroid Sarcoidosis Severe anemia Too much iron in the body (usually due to hereditary hemochromatosis) Underactive thyroid","Symptoms of heart failure often begin slowly. At first, they may only occur when you are very active. Over time, you may notice breathing problems and other symptoms even when you are resting. Symptoms may also appear suddenly after the heart is damaged from a heart attack or other problem. Common symptoms are: Cough Fatigue, weakness, faintness Loss of appetite Need to urinate at night Pulse that feels fast or irregular, or a sensation of feeling the heartbeat (palpitations) Shortness of breath when you are active or after you lie down Swollen (enlarged) liver or abdomen Swollen feet and ankles Waking up from sleep after a couple of hours due to shortness of breath Weight gain",,CHF; Congestive heart failure; Left-sided heart failure; Right-sided heart failure - cor pulmonale; Cardiomyopathy - heart failure; HF
Heart failure in children,Heart failure is a condition that results when the heart is no longer able to effectively pump oxygen-rich blood to meet the oxygen needs of the body's tissues and organs.,"The heart is composed of two independent pumping systems. One is on the right side, and the other is on the left. Each has two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle. The ventricles are the major pumps in the heart. The right system receives blood from the veins of the whole body. This is ""blue"" blood, which is poor in oxygen and rich in carbon dioxide. The left system receives blood from the lungs. This is ""red"" blood which has become rich in oxygen after passing through the lungs. Blood leaves the heart through the aorta, the major artery that feeds blood to the entire body. Valves are flaps that open and close so blood will flow in the right direction. There are four valves in the heart. One common way heart failure occurs in children is when the blood from the left side of the heart mixes with the right side of the heart. This leads to an overflow of blood into the lungs or one or more chambers of the heart. This occurs most often due to birth defects of the heart or major blood vessels . These include: A hole between the right or left upper or lower chambers of the heart A defect of the major arteries Defective heart valves that are leaky or narrowed A defect in the formation of the heart chambers Abnormal development or damage to the heart muscle is the other common cause of heart failure. This may be due to: Infection from a virus or bacteria that causes damage to the heart muscle or heart valves Drugs used for other illnesses, most often cancer drugs Abnormal heart rhythms Muscle disorders, such as muscular dystrophy Genetic disorders leading to abnormal development of the heart muscle","As the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, abdomen, and the arms and legs. This is called ""congestive heart failure"" or just ""heart failure"". Symptoms of heart failure may be present at birth, start during the first weeks of life, or develop slowly in an older child. Symptoms of heart failure in infants may include: Breathing problems, such as rapid breathing or breathing that appears to take more effort. These may be noticed when the child is resting or when feeding or crying. Taking longer than normal to feed or becoming too tired to continue feeding after a short time. Noticing a fast or strong heart beat through the chest wall when the child is at rest. Not gaining enough weight. Common symptoms in older children are: Cough Fatigue, weakness, faintness Loss of appetite Need to urinate at night Pulse that feels fast or irregular, or a sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) Shortness of breath when the child is active or after lying down Swollen (enlarged) liver or abdomen Swollen feet and ankles Waking up from sleep after a couple of hours due to shortness of breath Weight gain",,Congestive heart failure - children; Cor pulmonale - children; Cardiomyopathy - children; CHF - children; Congenital heart defect - heart failure in children; Cyanotic heart disease - heart failure in children; Birth defect of the heart - heart failure in children

Heart murmurs,"A heart murmur is a blowing, whooshing, or rasping sound heard during a heartbeat. The sound is caused by turbulent (rough) blood flow through the heart valves or near the heart.","Many heart murmurs are harmless. These types of murmurs are called innocent murmurs. They will not cause any symptoms or problems. Innocent murmurs do not need treatment. Other heart murmurs may indicate an abnormality in the heart. These abnormal murmurs can be caused by: Problems of the aortic valve ( aortic regurgitation , aortic stenosis) Problems of the mitral valve ( chronic or acute mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis ) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Pulmonary regurgitation (backflow of blood into the right ventricle, caused by failure of the pulmonary valve to close completely) Pulmonary valve stenosis Problems of the tricuspid valve ( tricuspid regurgitation , tricuspid stenosis) Significant murmurs in children are more likely to be caused by: Anomalous pulmonary venous return (an abnormal formation of the pulmonary veins) Atrial septal defect (ASD) Coarctation of the aorta Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Multiple murmurs may result from a combination of heart problems.

Heartburn,"Heartburn is a painful burning feeling just below or behind the breastbone. Most of the time, it comes from the esophagus. The pain often rises in your chest from your stomach. It may also spread to your neck or throat.","Almost everyone has heartburn at some time. If you have heartburn very often, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Normally when food or liquid enters your stomach, a band of muscle at the lower end of your esophagus closes off the esophagus. This band is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If this band does not close tightly enough, food or stomach acid can back up (reflux) into the esophagus. The stomach contents can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn and other symptoms. Watch this video about: Heartburn Heartburn is more likely if you have a hiatal hernia . A hiatal hernia is a condition which occurs when the top part of the stomach pokes into the chest cavity. This weakens the LES so that it is easier for acid to back up from the stomach into the esophagus. Pregnancy and many medicines can bring on heartburn or make it worse. Medicines that can cause heartburn include: Anticholinergics (such as medicines used for sea sickness) Beta-blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease Bronchodilators for asthma or other lung diseases Calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure Dopamine-like drugs for Parkinson disease Progestin for abnormal menstrual bleeding or birth control Sedatives for anxiety or sleep problems (insomnia) Theophylline (for asthma or other lung diseases) Tricyclic antidepressants Talk to your health care provider if you think one of your medicines may be causing heartburn. Never change or stop taking medicine without talking to your provider first.",,"You should treat frequent heartburn (heartburn that occurs 2 or more days per week) because reflux can damage the lining of your esophagus. This can cause serious problems over time. Changing your habits can be helpful in preventing heartburn and other symptoms of GERD. The following tips will help you avoid heartburn and other GERD symptoms. Talk to your provider if you are still bothered by heartburn after trying these steps. First, avoid foods and drinks that can trigger reflux, such as: Alcohol Caffeine Carbonated drinks Chocolate Citrus fruits and juices Peppermint and spearmint Spicy or fatty foods, full-fat dairy products Tomatoes and tomato sauces Next, try changing your eating habits: Avoid bending over or exercising just after eating. Avoid eating within 3 to 4 hours of bedtime. Lying down with a full stomach causes the stomach contents to press harder against the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This allows reflux to occur. Eat smaller meals. Make other lifestyle changes as needed: Avoid tight-fitting belts or clothes that are snug around the waist. These items can squeeze the stomach, and may force food to reflux. Lose weight if you are overweight. Obesity increases pressure in the stomach. This pressure can push the stomach contents into the esophagus. In some cases, GERD symptoms go away after an overweight person loses 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms). Sleep with your head raised about 6 inches (15 centimeters). Sleeping with the head higher than the stomach helps prevent digested food from backing up into the esophagus. Place books, bricks, or blocks under the legs of the head of your bed. You can also use a wedge-shaped pillow under your mattress. Sleeping on extra pillows does NOT work well for relieving heartburn because you can slip off the pillows during the night. Stop smoking or using tobacco. Chemicals in cigarette smoke or tobacco products weaken the LES. Reduce stress. Try yoga, tai chi, or meditation to help relax. If you still do not have full relief, try over-the-counter medicines: Antacids, like Maalox, Mylanta, or Tums help neutralize stomach acid. H2 blockers, like Pepcid AC, Tagamet HB, and Axid AR reduce stomach acid production. Proton pump inhibitors, like Prilosec OTC, Prevacid 24 HR, Nexium 24 HR, and Zegerid OTC stop nearly all stomach acid production.",Pyrosis; GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease); Esophagitis

You are more likely to feel the effects of heat sooner if: You are not used to high temperatures or high humidity. You are a child or an older adult. You are already ill from another cause or have been injured. You are obese. You are also exercising. Even a person who is in good shape can suffer heat illness if warning signs are ignored. The following make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature, and make a heat emergency more likely: Drinking alcohol before or during exposure to heat or high humidity Not drinking enough fluids when you're active on warmer or hot days Heart disease Certain medicines: Examples are beta-blockers, water pills or diuretics, some medicines used to treat depression, psychosis , or ADHD Sweat gland problems Wearing too much clothing","Muscle cramps are the first stage of heat illness. If heat exposure continues and these symptoms are not treated, they can lead to heat exhaustion and then heat stroke. Heat stroke occurs when the body is no longer able to regulate its temperature, and it keeps rising. Heat stroke can cause shock, brain damage, organ failure, and even death. The early symptoms of heat illness include: Muscle cramps and pains that most often occur in the legs or abdomen, and may be due to multiple factors including exercising in the heat. Fatigue Thirst Very heavy sweating Later symptoms of heat exhaustion include: Cool, moist skin Dark urine Dizziness , lightheadedness Headache Nausea and vomiting Weakness Rapid, shallow breathing Rapid, weak pulse The symptoms of heatstroke include those of heat exhaustion in combination with very high body temperature and significant neurologic symptoms (call 911 or the local emergency number right away): Fever -- temperature above 104°F (40°C) Extreme confusion (altered level of consciousness) Irrational behavior Seizures Unconsciousness (loss of responsiveness)",,Heatstroke; Heat illness; Dehydration - heat emergency

H pylori infection is the most common cause of peptic ulcers. However, the infection does not cause problems for most people.","H pylori bacteria are most likely passed directly from person to person. This tends to happen during childhood. The infection remains throughout life if not treated. It's not clear how the bacteria are passed from one person to another. The bacteria may spread from: Mouth-to-mouth contact GI tract illness (particularly when vomiting occurs) Contact with stool (fecal material) Contaminated food and water The bacteria may trigger ulcers in the following way: H pylori enters the mucus layer of the stomach and attaches to the stomach lining. H pylori cause the stomach to produce more stomach acid. This damages the stomach lining, leading to ulcers in some people. Besides ulcers, H pylori bacteria can also cause a chronic inflammation in the stomach (gastritis) or the upper part of the small intestine (duodenitis) and duodenal ulcers. H pylori can also sometimes lead to stomach cancer or a rare type of stomach lymphoma.","About 10% to 15% of people infected with H pylori develop peptic ulcer disease.

Hemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow isn't making enough red cells to replace the ones that are being destroyed. There are several possible causes of hemolytic anemia. Red blood cells may be destroyed due to: An autoimmune problem in which the immune system mistakenly sees your own red blood cells as foreign substances and destroys them Genetic variations within the red cells (such as sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , and G6PD deficiency ) Exposure to certain chemicals, medicines, and toxins Infections Blood clots in small blood vessels Transfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match yours Faulty, damaged, or artificial heart valves","You may not have symptoms if the anemia is mild. If the problem develops slowly, the first symptoms may be: Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise Feelings that your heart is pounding or racing Headaches Problems concentrating or thinking If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: Lightheadedness when you stand up Pale skin Shortness of breath Sore tongue Left upper abdominal pain due to an enlarged spleen",,Anemia - hemolytic
Hemolytic anemia caused by chemicals and toxins,Hemolytic anemia caused by chemicals and toxins is a lack of red blood cells that occurs when red blood cells are excessively damaged by certain chemicals or toxins.,"Possible substances that can cause hemolytic anemia include: Anti-malaria drugs (quinine compounds) Arsenic Dapsone Intravenous water infusion (not half-normal saline or normal saline) Metals (chromium/chromates, platinum salts, nickel compounds, copper, lead, cis-platinum) Nitrites Nitrofurantoin Penicillin Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) Rho immune globulin (WinRho) Ribavirin Snake bites (some snake venom contains hemolytic toxins ) Sulfonamides Sulfones This list is not all-inclusive.",,,Anemia - hemolytic - caused by chemicals or toxins
Hemolytic crisis,Hemolytic crisis occurs when large numbers of red blood cells are destroyed over a short time. The loss of red blood cells occurs much faster than the body can produce new red blood cells.,Causes of hemolysis include: A lack of certain proteins inside red blood cells Autoimmune diseases Certain infections Defects in the hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells Defects of the proteins that make up the internal framework of red blood cells Side effects of certain medicines Reactions to blood transfusions,,,Hemolysis - acute
Hemolytic disease of the newborn,"Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is a blood disorder in a fetus or newborn infant. In some infants, it can be fatal.","During pregnancy, RBCs from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's blood through the placenta. HDN occurs when the immune system of the mother sees a baby's RBCs as foreign. Antibodies then develop against the baby's RBCs. These antibodies attack the RBCs in the baby's blood and cause them to break down too early. HDN may develop when a mother and her unborn baby have different blood types. The types are based on small substances (antigens) on the surface of the blood cells. There is more than one way in which the unborn baby's blood type may not match the mother's. A, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood group antigens or types. This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, this is not very severe. Rh is short for the ""rhesus"" antigen or blood type. People are either positive or negative for this antigen. If the mother is Rh-negative and the baby in the womb has Rh-positive cells, her antibodies to the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and cause very severe anemia in the baby. It can be prevented in most cases. There are other, much less common, types of mismatch between minor blood group antigens. Some of these can also cause severe problems.","HDN can destroy the newborn baby's blood cells very quickly, which can cause symptoms such as: Edema (swelling under the surface of the skin) Newborn jaundice which occurs sooner and is more severe than normal",,Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN); Erythroblastosis fetalis; Anemia - HDN; Blood incompatibility - HDN; ABO incompatibility - HDN; Rh incompatibility - HDN
Hemolytic transfusion reaction,"A hemolytic transfusion reaction is a serious complication that can occur after a blood transfusion. The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.","Blood is classified into four different types: A, B, AB, and O. Another way blood cells may be classified is by Rh factors. People who have Rh factors in their blood are called ""Rh positive."" People without these factors are called ""Rh negative."" Rh negative people form antibodies against Rh factor if they receive Rh positive blood. There are also many other blood-related factors that differ among people, in addition to ABO and Rh. Your immune system can usually tell its own blood cells from those of another person. If you receive blood that is even partially not compatible with your blood, your body produces antibodies to destroy the donor's blood cells. This process causes the transfusion reaction. Blood that you receive in a transfusion must be compatible with your own blood. This means that your body does not have antibodies against the blood you receive. Most of the time, a blood transfusion between compatible groups (such as O+ to O+) does not cause a problem. However, minor mismatches in blood factors can cause a reaction. It is usually mild. Blood transfusions between incompatible groups (such as A+ to O-) cause an immune response. This can lead to a serious transfusion reaction. The immune system attacks the donated blood cells, destroying them. Today, all blood is carefully screened. Transfusion reactions are rare.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Back pain Bloody urine Chills Fainting or dizziness Fever Flank pain Flushing of the skin Symptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction most often appear during or right after the transfusion. Sometimes, they may develop after several days (delayed transfusion reaction).",,Blood transfusion reaction; Transfusion reaction
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,Shiga-like toxin producing E coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a disorder that most often occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances. These substances destroy red blood cells and cause kidney injury.,"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) often occurs after a gastrointestinal infection with E coli bacteria ( Escherichia coli O157:H7). However, the condition has also been linked to other gastrointestinal infections, including shigella and salmonella . It has also been linked to non-gastrointestinal infections. HUS is most common in children. It is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in children. Several large outbreaks have been linked to undercooked hamburger meat contaminated with E coli . E coli can be transmitted through: Contact from one person to another Consuming uncooked food, such as milk products or beef STEC-HUS is not to be confused with atypical HUS (aHUS) which is not infection-related. It is similar to another disease called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).","STEC-HUS often begins with vomiting and diarrhea, which may be bloody. Within a week, the person may become weak and irritable. People with this condition may urinate less than normal. Urine output may almost stop. Red blood cell destruction leads to symptoms of anemia . Early symptoms: Blood in the stools Irritability Fever Lethargy Vomiting and diarrhea Weakness Later symptoms: Bruising Decreased consciousness Low urine output No urine output Pallor Seizures -- rare Skin rash that looks like fine red spots ( petechiae )",,HUS; STEC-HUS; Hemolytic-uremic syndrome
Hemophilia,Hemophilia refers to a group of bleeding disorders in which blood clotting takes a longer time than normal.,"When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or aren't functioning like they should. Hemophilia is caused by the lack of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. In most cases, hemophilia is passed down through families (inherited). Most of the time, it is passed to male children.","The main symptom of hemophilia is bleeding. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases may not be detected until later in life, after excessive bleeding following surgery or an injury. Precautions may need to be taken before engaging in sports. In the worst cases, bleeding occurs for no reason. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere and bleeding into joints is common.",,Hemophilia A; Classic hemophilia; Factor VIII deficiency; Hemophilia B; Christmas disease; Factor IX deficiency; Bleeding disorder - hemophilia

Hemophilia A,"Hemophilia A is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor VIII. Without enough factor VIII, the blood cannot clot properly to control bleeding.","When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should. Factor VIII (eight) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia A is the result of the body not making enough factor VIII. Hemophilia A is caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the variant gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two copies of the X chromosome. So if the factor VIII gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII. Males have only one X chromosome. If the factor VIII gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have hemophilia A. For this reason, most people with hemophilia A are male. If a woman has a variant factor VIII gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the variant gene can be passed down to her children. Boys born to such women have a 50% chance of having hemophilia A. Their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier. All female children of men with hemophilia carry the variant gene whereas male children do not. Risk factors for hemophilia A include: Family history of bleeding Being male","The severity of symptoms vary. Prolonged bleeding is the main symptom. It is often first seen when an infant is circumcised. Other bleeding problems usually show up when the infant starts crawling and walking. Mild cases may go unnoticed until later in life. Symptoms may first occur after surgery or injury. Internal bleeding may occur anywhere. Symptoms may include: Bleeding into joints with associated pain and swelling Blood in the urine or stool Bruising Gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract bleeding Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding from cuts, tooth extraction, and surgery Bleeding that starts without cause",,Factor VIII deficiency; Classic hemophilia; Bleeding disorder - hemophilia A
Hemophilia B,"Hemophilia B is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor IX. Without enough factor IX, the blood cannot clot properly to control bleeding.","When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors.

Hemorrhoid surgery,Hemorrhoids are swollen veins around the anus. They may be inside the anus (internal hemorrhoids) or outside the anus (external hemorrhoids).,,,,Hemorrhoidectomy
Hemorrhoids,Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus or lower part of the rectum.,"Hemorrhoids are very common. They result from increased pressure on the anus. This can occur during pregnancy or childbirth, and due to constipation. The pressure causes the normal anal veins and tissue to swell. This tissue can bleed, often during bowel movements. Hemorrhoids may be caused by: Straining during bowel movements Constipation Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet Certain diseases, such as cirrhosis Hemorrhoids may be inside or outside the body. Internal hemorrhoids occur just inside the anus, at the beginning of the rectum. When they are large, they may fall outside (prolapse). The most common problem with internal hemorrhoids is bleeding during bowel movements. External hemorrhoids occur outside the anus. They can result in difficulty cleaning the area after a bowel movement. If a blood clot forms in an external hemorrhoid, it can be very painful (thrombosed external hemorrhoid).","Hemorrhoids are most often not painful, but if a blood clot forms, they can be very painful. Common symptoms include: Painless bright red blood from the rectum Anal itching Anal ache or pain, especially while sitting Pain during bowel movements One or more hard or tender lumps near the anus",,Rectal lump; Piles; Lump in the rectum; Rectal bleeding - hemorrhoids; Blood in the stool - hemorrhoids
Hemothorax,Hemothorax is a collection of blood in the space between the chest wall and the lung (the pleural cavity).,"The most common cause of hemothorax is chest trauma. It can sometimes be accompanied by air in the pleural cavity that may let the lung partially collapse (pneumothorax). Hemothorax can also occur in people who have: A blood clotting defect Chest (thoracic) or heart surgery Death of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction) Lung or pleural cancer -- primary or secondary (metastatic, or from another site) A tear in a blood vessel when placing a central venous catheter or when associated with severe high blood pressure Tuberculosis","Symptoms include: Shortness of breath Rapid, shallow breathing Chest pain Low blood pressure (shock) Pale, cool and clammy skin Rapid heart rate Restlessness Anxiety",,

Hepatic hemangioma,A hepatic hemangioma is a liver mass made of widened (dilated) blood vessels. It is not cancerous.,"A hepatic hemangioma is the most common type of liver mass that is not caused by cancer. It may be a birth defect. Hepatic hemangiomas can occur at any time. They are most common in people in their 30s to 50s. Women get these masses more often than men. The masses are often bigger in size. Babies may develop a type of hepatic hemangioma called benign infantile hemangioendothelioma. This is also known as multinodular hepatic hemangiomatosis. This is a rare, noncancerous tumor that has been linked to high rates of heart failure and death in infants. Infants are most often diagnosed by the time they are 6 months old.","Some hemangiomas may cause bleeding or interfere with organ function. Most do not produce symptoms. In rare cases, the hemangioma may rupture.",,Liver hemangioma; Hemangioma of the liver; Cavernous hepatic hemangioma; Infantile hemangioendothelioma; Multinodular hepatic hemangiomatosis
Hepatic ischemia,Hepatic ischemia is a condition in which the liver does not get enough blood or oxygen.

Such conditions may include: Abnormal heart rhythms Dehydration Heart failure Infection, especially sepsis Severe bleeding Other causes may include: Blood clots in the main artery to the liver (hepatic artery) after a liver transplant Inflammation of blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow (vasculitis) Burns Heat stroke Having a sickle cell crisis",The person may have an altered mental status due to reduced blood flow to the brain. Other symptoms may include: Loss of appetite Feeling of general discomfort Discomfort in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen Jaundice Damage to the liver cells most often does not cause symptoms until it affects liver function. Blood clots in the liver's main artery may cause abdominal pain.,,Ischemic hepatitis; Shock liver
Hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari),"Hepatic vein obstruction is a blockage of the hepatic vein, which carries blood away from the liver.","Hepatic vein obstruction prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart. This blockage can cause liver damage. Obstruction of this vein can be caused by a tumor or growth pressing on the vessel, or by a clot in the vessel (hepatic vein thrombosis). Most often, it is caused by conditions that make blood clots more likely to form, including: Abnormal growth of cells in the bone marrow (myeloproliferative disorders) Cancers Chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases Infections Inherited (hereditary) or acquired problems with excessive blood clotting Oral contraceptives Pregnancy Hepatic vein blockage is the most common cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome.",Symptoms include: Abdominal swelling or stretching due to fluid in the abdomen Pain in the right upper abdomen Vomiting blood Yellowing of the skin (jaundice),,Budd-Chiari syndrome; Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
Hepatitis,Hepatitis is swelling and inflammation of the liver.,"Hepatitis can be caused by: Immune cells in the body attacking the liver (autoimmune hepatitis) Infections from viruses (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C), bacteria, or parasites Liver damage from alcohol or poison Medicines, such as an overdose of acetaminophen Fatty liver Liver disease can also be caused by inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis or hemochromatosis, a condition that involves having too much iron in your body. Other causes include Wilson disease, a disorder in which the body retains too much copper and ingestion of toxic mushrooms.","Hepatitis may start and get better quickly. It may also become a long-term condition. In some cases, hepatitis may lead to liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer or even death. There are several factors that can affect how severe the condition is. These may include the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is most often short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems. The symptoms of hepatitis include: Pain or bloating in the belly area Dark urine and pale or clay-colored stools Fatigue Low grade fever Itching Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Weight loss You may not have symptoms when first infected with hepatitis B or C. You can still develop liver failure later. If you have any risk factors for either type of hepatitis, ask your health care provider whether you should be tested for them.",,
Hepatitis A,Hepatitis A is inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the liver from the hepatitis A virus.,"The hepatitis A virus is found mostly in the stool and blood of an infected person. The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness. You can catch hepatitis A if: You eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Unpeeled and uncooked fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease. You come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease. A person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the toilet. You take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact. Not everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection. Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported. Risk factors include: Overseas travel, especially to Asia, South or Central America, Africa and the Middle East Injection drug use Living in a nursing home Working in a health care, food, or sewage industry Eating raw shellfish such as oysters and clams Other common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis A is the least serious and mildest of these diseases, but can still be a dangerous illness.","Symptoms most often show up 2 to 6 weeks after being exposed to the hepatitis A virus.

A child can catch hepatitis A by: Coming in contact with the blood or stool of a person who has the disease. Eating or drinking food or water that has been contaminated by blood or stools containing the HAV. Fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease. Eating food prepared by someone with the disease who does not wash their hands after using the bathroom. Being lifted or carried by someone with the disease who does not wash their hands after using the bathroom. Traveling to another country without being vaccinated for hepatitis A. Children can get hepatitis A at day care center from other children or from child care workers who have the virus and do not practice good hygiene. Other common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C . Hepatitis A is typically the least serious and mildest of these diseases.","Most children age 6 years and younger do not have any symptoms. This means that your child could have the disease, and you may not know it. This can make it easy to spread the disease among young children. When symptoms occur, they appear about 2 to 6 weeks after infection. The child may have flu-like symptoms, or the symptoms may be mild. Severe or fulminant hepatitis (liver failure) is rare in healthy children. The symptoms are often easy to manage and include: Dark urine Tiredness Loss of appetite Fever Nausea and vomiting Pale stools Abdominal pain (over the liver) Yellow skin and eyes ( jaundice )",,Viral hepatitis - children; Infectious hepatitis - children

You may feel sick for a period of days or weeks. You may become very ill very quickly (called fulminant hepatitis). Symptoms of hepatitis B may not appear for up to 6 months after the time of infection. Early symptoms include: Appetite loss Fatigue Low fever Muscle and joint aches Nausea and vomiting Yellow skin and dark urine Symptoms will go away in a few weeks to months if your body is able to fight off the infection. Some people never get rid of the HBV. This is called chronic hepatitis B. People with chronic hepatitis may not have symptoms and may not know they are infected. Over time, they may develop symptoms of liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver. You can spread the HBV to other people, even if you have no symptoms.",,

Hepatocerebral degeneration,Hepatocerebral degeneration is a brain disorder that occurs in people with liver damage.,"This condition may occur in any case of acquired liver failure, including severe hepatitis . Liver damage can lead to the buildup of ammonia and other toxic materials in the body. This happens when the liver doesn't work properly. It does not break down and eliminate these chemicals. The toxic materials can damage brain tissue. Specific areas of the brain, such as the basal ganglia, are more likely to be injured from liver failure. The basal ganglia help control movement. This condition is the ""non-Wilsonian"" type. This means that the liver damage is not caused by copper deposits in the liver. This is a key feature of Wilson disease .","Symptoms may include: Difficulty walking Impaired intellectual function Jaundice Muscle spasm (myoclonus) Rigidity Shaking of arms, head (tremor) Twitching Uncontrolled body movements ( chorea ) Tremor of the hand when the wrist is extended (also called a flapping tremor or asterixis) Unsteady walking ( ataxia )",,Chronic acquired (Non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration; Hepatic encephalopathy; Portosystemic encephalopathy
Hepatorenal syndrome,Hepatorenal syndrome is a condition in which there is progressive kidney failure that occurs in a person with cirrhosis of the liver. It is a serious complication that can lead to death.,"Hepatorenal syndrome occurs when the kidneys stop working well in people with serious liver problems. Less urine is produced by the body, so waste products that contain nitrogen build up in the bloodstream ( azotemia ). The disorder occurs in up to 1 in 10 people who are in the hospital with liver failure. It leads to kidney failure in people with: Acute liver failure Alcoholic hepatitis Cirrhosis Infected abdominal fluid (peritonitis) Risk factors include: Blood pressure that falls when a person rises or suddenly changes position (orthostatic hypotension) Use of medicines called diuretics (""water pills"") Gastrointestinal bleeding Infection Recent abdominal fluid removal (paracentesis)","Symptoms include: Abdominal swelling due to fluid (called ascites, a symptom of liver disease) Mental confusion Muscle jerks Dark-colored urine (a symptom of liver disease) Decreased urine output Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Yellow skin (jaundice, a symptom of liver disease)",,Cirrhosis - hepatorenal; Liver failure - hepatorenal; HRS

Hereditary angioedema,"Hereditary angioedema is a rare but serious problem with the immune system. The problem is passed down through families. It causes swelling, particularly of the face and airways, and intestines (causing severe abdominal pain).","Angioedema is swelling that is similar to hives , but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface. Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is caused by a low level or improper function of a protein called the C1 inhibitor. It affects the blood vessels. An HAE attack can result in rapid swelling of the hands, feet, limbs, face, intestinal tract, larynx (voicebox), or trachea (windpipe). Attacks of swelling can become more severe in late childhood and adolescence. There is usually a family history of the condition. But relatives may be unaware of previous cases, which may have been reported as an unexpected, sudden, and premature death of a parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent. Dental procedures, sickness (including colds and the flu), and surgery may trigger HAE attacks.","Symptoms include: Airway blockage -- involves throat swelling and sudden hoarseness Repeat episodes of abdominal cramping without obvious cause Swelling in the hands, arms, legs, lips, eyes, tongue, throat, or genitals Swelling of the intestines -- can be severe and lead to abdominal cramping, vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, pain, and occasionally shock A non-itchy, red rash",,Quincke disease; HAE - Hereditary angioedema; Kallikrein inhibitor - HAE; Bradykinin receptor antagonist - HAE; C1-inhibitors - HAE; Hives - HAE
Hereditary elliptocytosis,Hereditary elliptocytosis is a disorder passed down through families in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped. It is similar to other blood conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary ovalocytosis.,"Elliptocytosis affects about 1 in every 2,500 people of northern European heritage. It is more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your family has had it.",Symptoms may include: Fatigue. Shortness of breath. Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice). This may continue for a long time in a newborn.,,Elliptocytosis - hereditary
Hereditary fructose intolerance,"Hereditary fructose intolerance is a disorder in which a person lacks the protein needed to break down fructose. Fructose is a fruit sugar that naturally occurs in the body. Man-made fructose is used as a sweetener in many foods, including baby food and drinks.","This condition occurs when the body is missing an enzyme called aldolase B. This substance is needed to break down fructose. If a person without this substance eats fructose or sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar), complicated chemical changes occur in the body. The body cannot change its stored form of sugar (glycogen) into glucose. As a result, blood sugar falls and dangerous substances build up in the liver. Hereditary fructose intolerance is inherited, which means it can be passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the aldolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected.","Symptoms can be seen after a baby starts eating food or formula. The early symptoms of fructose intolerance are similar to those of galactosemia (inability to use the sugar galactose). Later symptoms relate more to liver disease. Symptoms may include: Convulsions Excessive sleepiness Irritability Yellow skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice) Poor feeding and growth as a baby, failure to thrive Problems after eating fruits and other foods that contain fructose or sucrose Vomiting",,"Fructosemia; Fructose intolerance; Fructose aldolase B-deficiency; Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase deficiency"
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of the blood vessels that can cause excessive bleeding.,HHT is passed down through families in an autosomal dominant pattern . This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Scientists have identified four genes involved in this condition. All of these genes appear to be important for blood vessels to develop properly. A mutation in any one of these genes is responsible for HHT.,"People with HHT can develop abnormal blood vessels in several areas of the body. These vessels are called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). If they are on the skin, they are called telangiectasias . The most common sites include the lips, tongue, ears, and fingers. The abnormal blood vessels can also develop in the brain, lungs, liver, intestines, or other areas. Symptoms of this syndrome include: Frequent nosebleeds in children Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) , including loss of blood in the stool, or dark or black stools Seizures or unexplained, small strokes (from bleeding into the brain) Shortness of breath Enlarged liver Heart failure Anemia caused by low iron",,HHT; Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome; Osler-Weber-Rendu disease; Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome
Hereditary ovalocytosis,Hereditary ovalocytosis is a rare condition passed down through families (inherited). The blood cells are oval-shaped instead of round. It is a form of hereditary elliptocytosis.,Hereditary ovalocytosis is mainly found in Southeast Asian populations.,Newborn infants with hereditary ovalocytosis may have anemia and jaundice . Adults most often do not show symptoms.,,Ovalocytosis - hereditary
Hereditary spherocytic anemia,"Hereditary spherocytic anemia is a rare disorder of the surface layer (membrane) of red blood cells. It leads to red blood cells that are shaped like spheres, and premature breakdown of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia).","This disorder is caused by a genetic variation. The variant gene results in an abnormal red blood cell membrane. The affected cells have a smaller surface area for their volume than normal red blood cells, and can break open easily. The anemia can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases the disorder may be found in early childhood. In mild cases it may go unnoticed until adulthood. This disorder is most common in people of northern European descent, but it has been found in all races.",Infants may have yellowing of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) and pale coloring ( pallor ). Other symptoms may include: Fatigue Irritability Shortness of breath Weakness,,Congenital spherocytic hemolytic anemia; Spherocytosis; Hemolytic anemia - spherocytic
Hereditary urea cycle abnormality,Hereditary urea cycle abnormalities are inherited conditions. They can cause problems with the removal of waste from the body in the urine.,"The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body. The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise. Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder have a defective gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body. These diseases include: Argininosuccinic aciduria Arginase deficiency Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency Citrullinemia N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS) deficiency Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders. Because this is an X-linked condition, boys are more often affected by OTC deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected with OTC. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and can develop the disease later in life. Because they are autosomal recessive conditions, the other conditions that cause this problem affect both girls and boys equally. To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry a non-working copy of the gene until their child gets the disorder.","Typically, an affected baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This most often occurs within the first week after birth. Symptoms include: Confusion Decreased food intake Dislike of foods that contain protein Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up Nausea, vomiting",,Abnormality of the urea cycle - hereditary; Urea cycle - hereditary abnormality
Hernia,A hernia is a sac formed by the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). The sac comes through a hole or weak area in the strong layer of the belly wall that surrounds the muscle. This layer is called the fascia.,"Usually, there is no clear cause of a hernia. Sometimes, hernias can occur due to: Heavy lifting Straining while using the toilet Any activity that raises the pressure inside the belly Hernias may be present at birth, but the bulge may not be evident until later in life. Some people have a family history of hernias. Babies and children can get hernias. It happens when there is weakness in the belly wall. Inguinal hernias are common in boys. Some children do not have symptoms until they are adults. Any activity or medical problem that increases pressure on the tissue in the belly wall and muscles may lead to a hernia, including: Long-term (chronic) constipation and pushing hard (straining) to have a bowel movement Chronic coughing or sneezing Cystic fibrosis Enlarged prostate , straining to urinate Extra weight Fluid in the abdomen ( ascites ) Peritoneal dialysis Poor nutrition Smoking Overexertion Undescended testicles","There are usually no symptoms other than a visible bulge. Some people have discomfort or pain. The discomfort may be worse when standing, straining, or lifting heavy objects. In time, the most common complaint is a bump that is sore and growing. When a hernia gets bigger, the small intestine inside it may get stuck in the hole and lose its blood supply. This is called strangulation. This causes pain and swelling at the site of strangulation. Symptoms may include: Nausea and vomiting Not being able to pass gas or have bowel movements When this occurs, surgery is needed right away.",,Hernia - inguinal; Inguinal hernia; Direct and indirect hernia; Rupture; Strangulation; Incarceration
Herniated disk,A herniated (slipped) disk occurs when all or part of a disk is forced through a weakened part of the disk. This may place pressure on nearby nerves or the spinal cord.,"The bones (vertebrae) of the spinal column protect nerves that come out of the brain and travel down your back to form the spinal cord. Nerve roots are large nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and leave your spinal column between each vertebra. The spinal bones are separated by disks. These disks cushion the spinal column and put space between your vertebrae. The disks allow movement between the vertebrae, which lets you bend and reach. With herniated disk: The disk may move out of place (herniate) or break open (rupture) from injury or strain . When this happens, there may be pressure on one or more spinal nerves. This can lead to pain, numbness, or weakness. The lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area affected by a herniated disk. The neck (cervical) disks are the second most commonly affected area. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) disks are rarely involved. A herniated disk is a cause of radiculopathy. This is a condition that affects the spinal nerve roots. Herniated disks occur more often in middle-aged and older men, usually after strenuous activity. Other risk factors may include: Lifting heavy objects Being overweight Repetitive bending or twisting the lower back Sitting or standing in same position for long hours Inactive lifestyle Smoking Watch this video about: Herniated nucleus pulposus (slipped disk)","The pain most often occurs on one side of the body. Symptoms vary, depending on the site of injury, and may include the following: With a herniated disk in your lower back, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip, or buttocks, and numbness in other parts. You may also feel pain or numbness on the back of the calf or sole of the foot. The same leg may also feel weak. With a herniated disk in your neck, you may have pain when moving your neck, deep pain near or over the shoulder blade, or pain that moves to the upper arm, forearm, and fingers. You can also have numbness along your shoulder, elbow, forearm, and fingers. The pain often starts slowly. It may get worse: After standing or sitting At night When sneezing, coughing, or laughing When bending backward or walking more than a few yards or meters When straining or holding your breath, such as when having a bowel movement You may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your health care provider examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your leg or arm, standing on your toes on one side, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, or other problems. Your bladder control may be lost.

Heroin overdose,Heroin is a pain-killer derived from morphine. It is very addictive and known for causing significant withdrawal symptoms. It has been illegal in the United States since 1924. It is in the class of drugs known as opioids.,,"People use heroin to get high because of its effects of short-lived euphoria and blissful apathy. But if they overdose on it, they get extremely sleepy and may become unconsciousness and stop breathing. Most deaths from heroin are due to not breathing. Below are symptoms of a heroin overdose in different parts of the body. AIRWAYS AND LUNGS No breathing Shallow breathing Slow and difficult breathing EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT Dry mouth Extremely small pupils, sometimes as small as the head of a pin (pinpoint pupils) Discolored tongue HEART AND BLOOD Low blood pressure Weak pulse SKIN Bluish-colored nails and lips (cyanosis) STOMACH AND INTESTINES Constipation Spasms of the stomach and intestines NERVOUS SYSTEM Coma (lack of responsiveness) Delirium (confusion) Disorientation Drowsiness Uncontrolled muscle movements","Seek medical help right away. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to do so. In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of a medicine called naloxone (brand name Narcan) to reverse the effects of a heroin overdose. This type of medicine is called an antidote. Naloxone is injected under the skin or into a muscle, using an automatic injector. It is also available as a nasal spray. It can be used by emergency medical responders, police, family members, caregivers, and others. It can save lives until medical care is available.",Acetomorphine overdose; Diacetylmorphine overdose; Opiate overdose; Opioid overdose

It is most often seen in children ages 3 to 10, but it can occur in any age group. It is most often caused by Coxsackie group A viruses. These viruses are contagious. Your child is at risk for herpangina if someone at school or home has the illness.","Symptoms may include: Fever Headache Loss of appetite Sore throat, or painful swallowing Ulcers in the mouth and throat, and similar sores on the feet, hands, and buttocks The ulcers most often have a white to whitish-gray base and a red border. They may be very painful. In most cases, there are only a few sores.",,
Herpes - oral,"Oral herpes is an infection of the lips, mouth, or gums due to the herpes simplex virus. It causes small, painful blisters commonly called cold sores or fever blisters. Oral herpes is also called herpes labialis.","Oral herpes is a common infection of the mouth area. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Most people in the United States are infected with this virus by age 20. After the first infection, the virus becomes dormant (an inactive state) in the nerve tissues in the face. Sometimes, the virus later reactivates, causing cold sores. Herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes . However, sometimes HSV-2 is spread to the mouth during oral sex, causing oral herpes. Herpes viruses spread most easily from individuals with an active outbreak or sore. You can catch this virus if you: Have intimate or personal contact with someone who is infected Touch an open herpes sore or something that has been in contact with the herpes virus, such as infected razors, towels, dishes, and other shared items Parents may spread the virus to their children during regular daily activities.","Some people get mouth ulcers when they first come into contact with HSV-1 virus. Others have no symptoms. Symptoms most often occur in kids between 1 and 5 years old. Symptoms may be mild or severe. They most often appear within 1 to 3 weeks after you come into contact with the virus. They may last up to 3 weeks.

High arch,High arch is a foot arch that is raised more than normal. The arch runs from the toes to the heel on the bottom of the foot. It is also called pes cavus.,"High foot arches are much less common than flat feet. They can be caused by a bone (orthopedic) or nerve (neurological) condition. Unlike flat feet, highly arched feet tend to be painful. This is so because more stress is placed on the section of the foot between the ankle and toes (metatarsals). This condition can make it difficult to fit into shoes. People who have high arches most often need foot support. A high arch may cause disability.","Symptoms include: Shortened foot length Difficulty fitting shoes Foot pain with walking, standing, and running (not everyone has this symptom)",,Pes cavus; High foot arch

High blood pressure and eye disease,High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back part of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain.,"The higher the blood pressure and the longer it has been high, the more severe the damage is likely to be. You have a higher risk of damage and vision loss when you also have diabetes, high cholesterol level, or you smoke. Rarely, very high blood pressure develops suddenly. However, when it does, it can cause severe changes in the eye. Other problems with the retina are also more likely, such as: Damage to the nerves in the eye due to poor blood flow Blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the retina Blockage of the veins that carry blood away from the retina","Most people with hypertensive retinopathy do not have symptoms until late in the disease. Symptoms may include: Double vision, dim vision, or vision loss Headaches Sudden symptoms are a medical emergency. It often means that the blood pressure is very high.",,Hypertensive retinopathy
High blood pressure in adults – hypertension,Blood pressure is a measurement of the force exerted against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood to your body.

High blood pressure in infants,High blood pressure (hypertension) is an increase in the force of blood against the arteries in the body. This article focuses on high blood pressure in infants.,"Blood pressure measures how hard the heart is working, and how healthy the arteries are. There are two numbers in each blood pressure measurement: The first (top) number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the force of blood released when the heart beats. The second (bottom) number is the diastolic pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest. Blood pressure measurements are written this way: 120/80. One or both of these numbers can be too high. Several factors affect blood pressure, including: Hormones The health of the heart and blood vessels The health of the kidneys High blood pressure in infants may be due to kidney or heart disease that is present at birth (congenital). Common examples include: Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing of the large blood vessel of the heart called the aorta) Patent ductus arteriosus (blood vessel between the aorta and pulmonary artery that should close after birth, but remains open) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (lung condition that affects newborn babies who were either put on a breathing machine after birth or were born very early) Kidney disease Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the major blood vessel of the kidney) In newborn babies, high blood pressure is often caused by a blood clot in a kidney blood vessel, a complication of having an umbilical artery catheter . Other causes of high blood pressure in infants may include: Certain medicines Exposure to illegal drugs such as cocaine Certain tumors Inherited conditions (problems that run in families) Thyroid problems Blood pressure rises as the baby grows. The average blood pressure in a newborn is 64/41. The average blood pressure in a child 1 month through 2 years old is 95/58. It is normal for these numbers to vary.","Most babies with high blood pressure will not have symptoms. Instead, symptoms may be related to the condition causing the high blood pressure.

Hip pain,Hip pain involves any pain in or around the hip joint. You may not feel pain from your hip directly over the hip area. You may feel it in your groin or pain in your thigh or knee.,"Hip pain may be caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip, including: Hip fractures -- can cause sudden and acute hip pain. These injuries can be serious and lead to major problems. It is more common in older patients because their bones can be weaker. Infection in the bones or joints . Osteonecrosis of the hip (necrosis from loss of blood supply to the bone). Arthritis -- often felt in the front part of the thigh or groin. Labral tear of the hip. Femoral acetabular impingement -- abnormal growth around your hip that is a precursor to hip arthritis. It can cause pain with movement and exercise. Pain in or around the hip may also be caused by problems such as: Bursitis -- pain when getting up from a chair, walking, climbing stairs, and driving Hamstring strain Iliotibial band syndrome Hip flexor strain Hip impingement syndrome Groin strain Snapping hip syndrome Pain you feel in the hip may reflect a problem in your back, rather than in the hip itself. Pain due to problems in the hip joint itself is often felt most in the groin.",,"Steps you can do to lessen hip pain include: Try to avoid activities that make pain worse. Take over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Sleep on the side of your body that does not have pain. Put a pillow between your legs. Lose weight if you are overweight. Ask your health care provider for help. Try not to stand for long periods of time. If you must stand, do so on a soft, cushioned surface. Stand with an equal amount of weight on each leg. Wear flat shoes that are cushioned and comfortable. Things you can do to avoid hip pain related to overuse or physical activity include: Always warm up before exercising and cool down afterward. Stretch your quadriceps and hamstrings. Avoid running straight down hills. Walk down instead. For exercise, swim instead of running or biking. Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track. Avoid running on cement. If you have flat feet, try special shoe inserts and arch supports (orthotics). Make sure your running shoes are made well, fit well, and have good cushioning. Cut down the amount of exercise you do. See your provider before exercising your hip if you think you may have arthritis or have injured your hip.",Pain - hip
Hirschsprung disease,"Hirschsprung disease causes a blockage of the large intestine. It occurs due to poor muscle movement in the bowel. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present from birth.","Muscle contractions in the gut help digested foods and liquids move through the intestine. This is called peristalsis. Nerves between the muscle layers trigger the contractions. In people with Hirschsprung disease, the nerves are missing from a part of the bowel. Areas without these nerves cannot push material through. This causes a blockage. Intestinal contents build up behind the blockage. The bowel and abdomen swell as a result. Hirschsprung disease causes about 25% of all newborn intestinal blockages. It occurs 5 times more often in males than in females. Hirschsprung disease is sometimes linked to other inherited or congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome.",Symptoms that may be present in newborns and infants include: Difficulty with bowel movements Failure to pass meconium shortly after birth Failure to pass a first stool within 24 to 48 hours after birth Infrequent but explosive stools Jaundice Poor feeding Poor weight gain Vomiting Watery diarrhea (in the newborn) Symptoms in older children: Constipation that gradually gets worse Fecal impaction Malnutrition Slow growth Swollen belly,,Congenital megacolon; Hirschsprung's disease

Histiocytosis,"Histiocytosis is a general name for a group of disorders or ""syndromes"" that involve an abnormal increase in the number of specialized white blood cells that are called histiocytes.","There has been debate as to whether Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease are inflammatory, immune disorders, or cancer-like conditions. Recently, through the use of genomics scientists have found that these forms of histiocytosis show gene changes (mutations) in early white blood cells. This leads to abnormal behavior in the cells. The abnormal cells then increase in various parts of body including the bones, skin, lungs, and other areas. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that can affect people of all ages. The highest rate is among children ages 5 to 10. Some forms of the disorder are genetic, which means they are inherited. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare form of histiocytosis affecting mainly adults that involves multiple parts of the body.","Both Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease can affect the whole body (systemic disorder). Symptoms can vary between children and adults, but they may have some of the same symptoms. Tumors in weight-bearing bones, such as the legs or spine, may cause the bones to fracture without an obvious reason. Symptoms in children may include: Abdominal pain Bone pain Delayed puberty Dizziness Ear drainage that continues long-term Eyes that appear to stick out more and more Irritability Failure to thrive Fever Frequent urination Headache Jaundice Limping Mental decline Rash Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp Seizures Short stature Swollen lymph glands Thirst and increased drinking of fluids Vomiting Weight loss Note: Children over 5 years old often have only bone involvement.

Histoplasma skin test,The histoplasma skin test is used to check if you have been exposed to a fungus called Histoplasma capsulatum. The fungus causes an infection called histoplasmosis.,,,,Histoplasmosis skin test
Histoplasmosis,Histoplasmosis is an infection that occurs from breathing in the spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.,"Histoplasmosis occurs throughout the world. In the United States, it is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states, especially in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. Histoplasma fungus grows as a mold in the soil. You may get sick when you breathe in spores produced by the fungus. Soil that contains bird or bat droppings may have larger amounts of this fungus. The threat is greatest after an old building is torn down, or in caves. This infection can occur in people with a healthy immune system. But, having a weakened immune system increases the risk of getting or reactivating this disease. Very young or very old people, or those with HIV/AIDS , cancer, or an organ transplant have more severe symptoms. People with long-term (chronic) lung disease (such as emphysema and bronchiectasis ) are also at higher risk for a more severe infection.","Most people have no symptoms, or only have a mild, flu-like illness. If symptoms do occur, they may include: Fever and chills Cough and chest pain that gets worse when breathing in Joint pain Mouth sores Red skin bumps, most often on the lower legs The infection may be active for a short period of time, and then the symptoms go away. Sometimes, the lung infection may become chronic. Symptoms include: Chest pain and shortness of breath Cough, possibly coughing up blood Fever and sweating In a small number of people, especially in those with a weakened immune system, histoplasmosis spreads throughout the body. This is called disseminated histoplasmosis. In response to the infection irritation and swelling (inflammation) occur. Symptoms may include: Chest pain from inflammation of the sac-like covering around the heart ( pericarditis ) Headache and neck stiffness from swelling of the membranes covering of the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) High fever",,Fungal infection - histoplasmosis; Ohio River Valley fever; Fibrosing mediastinitis
Histoplasmosis - acute (primary) pulmonary,Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is a respiratory infection that is caused by inhaling the spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.,"Histoplasma capsulatum is the name of the fungus that causes histoplasmosis. It is found in the central and eastern United States, eastern Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in the soil in river valleys. It gets into the soil mostly from bird and bat droppings. You can get sick when you breathe in spores that the fungus produces. Every year, thousands of people with a normal immune system worldwide are infected, but most do not become seriously sick. Most have no symptoms or have only a mild flu-like illness and recover without any treatment. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis may happen as an epidemic, with many people in one region becoming sick at the same time. People with weakened immune systems (see Symptoms section below) are more likely to: Develop the disease if exposed to the fungus Have the disease come back Have more symptoms, and more serious symptoms, than others who get the disease Risk factors include traveling to or living in the central or eastern United States near the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys and being exposed to the droppings of birds and bats. This threat is greatest after an old building is torn down and spores get into the air, or when exploring caves.","Most people with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. The most common symptoms are: Chest pain Chills Cough Fever Joint pain and stiffness Muscle aches and stiffness Rash (usually small sores on the lower legs) Shortness of breath Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis can be a serious illness in the very young, older people, and people with a weakened immune system, including those who: Have HIV/AIDS Have had bone marrow or solid organ transplants Take medicines that suppress their immune system Symptoms in these people may include: Inflammation around the heart (called pericarditis ) Serious lung infections Severe joint pain",,
Histrionic personality disorder,Histrionic personality disorder is a mental condition in which people act in a very emotional and dramatic way that draws attention to themselves.,Causes of histrionic personality disorder are unknown. Genes and early childhood events may be responsible. It is diagnosed more often in women than in men. Doctors believe that more men may have the disorder than are diagnosed. Histrionic personality disorder usually begins by late teens or early 20s.,"People with this disorder are usually able to function at a high level and can be successful socially and at work. Symptoms include: Acting or looking overly seductive Being easily influenced by other people Being overly concerned with their looks Being overly dramatic and emotional Being overly sensitive to criticism or disapproval Believing that relationships are more intimate than they actually are Blaming failure or disappointment on others Constantly seeking reassurance or approval Having a low tolerance for frustration or delayed gratification Needing to be the center of attention ( self-centeredness ) Quickly changing emotions, which may seem shallow to others",,Personality disorder - histrionic; Attention seeking - histrionic personality disorder
HIV/AIDS,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk for getting life-threatening infections and cancers. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS. Once a person has the virus, it stays inside the body for life.","The virus is spread (transmitted) person-to-person through certain body fluids: Blood Semen and preseminal fluid Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk HIV can be spread if these fluids come in contact with: Mucous membranes (inside of the mouth, penis, vagina, rectum) Damaged tissue (tissue that has been cut or scraped) The blood stream by injection HIV cannot be spread through sweat, saliva, or urine. In the United States, HIV is mainly spread: Through vaginal or anal sex without using a condom with someone who has HIV who is not taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV Through needle sharing or other equipment used to inject drugs with someone who has HIV Less often, HIV is spread: From mother to child . A pregnant woman can spread the virus to her unborn baby (fetus) through their shared blood circulation, or a nursing mother can pass it to her baby through her breast milk. Testing and treatment of HIV-positive mothers has helped lower the number of babies getting HIV. Through needle sticks or other sharp objects that are contaminated with HIV (mainly health care workers). The virus is NOT spread by: Casual contact, such as hugging or closed-mouth kissing Mosquitoes or pets Participating in sports Touching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus Eating food handled by a person with HIV Intimate contact with an HIV-positive person with a stably undetectable viral load HIV and blood or organ donation: HIV is not spread to a person who donates blood or organs. People who donate organs are never in direct contact with the people who receive them. Likewise, a person who donates blood is never in contact with the person receiving it. In all of these procedures, sterile needles and instruments are used. Blood banks and organ donor programs thoroughly check (screen) donors, blood, and tissues. It is very unlikely to get HIV from blood transfusions, blood products, or organ or tissue transplants. Risk factors for getting HIV include: Having unprotected anal or vaginal sex. Receptive anal sex is the riskiest. Having multiple partners also increases the risk. Using a new condom correctly every time you have sex greatly helps lower this risk. Using drugs and sharing needles or syringes. Having a sexual partner with HIV who is not taking HIV medicines or who has a detectable viral load. Having a sexually-transmitted disease (STD).","Symptoms related to acute HIV infection (when a person is first infected) can be similar to the flu or other viral illnesses. They include: Fever and muscle pains Headache Sore throat Night sweats Mouth sores, including yeast infection ( thrush ) Swollen lymph glands Diarrhea Many people have no symptoms when they are first infected with HIV. Acute HIV infection (Stage 1) progresses over a few weeks to months to become chronic or asymptomatic HIV infection (Stage 2) (no symptoms). This stage can last 10 years or longer. During this period, the person might have no reason to suspect they have HIV, but they can spread the virus to others. If they are not treated, almost all people infected with HIV will develop AIDS (Stage 3). Some people develop AIDS within a few years of infection. Others remain completely healthy after 10 or even 20 years (called long-term nonprogressors). People with AIDS have had their immune system damaged by HIV. They are at very high risk of getting infections that are uncommon in people with a healthy immune system. These infections are called opportunistic infections and can affect any part of the body. These can be caused by: Bacteria Viruses Fungi Protozoa People with AIDS are also at higher risk for certain cancers, especially lymphomas and a skin cancer called Kaposi sarcoma . Symptoms depend on the particular infection and which part of the body is infected. Lung infections are common in people with AIDS and often cause cough , fever, and shortness of breath. Intestinal infections are also common and can cause: Diarrhea Abdominal pain Vomiting Swallowing problems Other common symptoms in people with HIV infection and AIDS include: Weight loss Fever Sweats Rashes Swollen lymph glands",,HIV infection; Infection - HIV; Human immunodeficiency virus; Acquired immune deficiency syndrome: HIV-1

HIV/AIDS in pregnant women and infants,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk of getting life-threatening infections and cancers. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS.","Most children with HIV get the virus when it passes from an HIV-positive mother to the child. This can occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or when breastfeeding. Only blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk have been shown to transmit infection to others. The virus is NOT spread to infants by: Casual contact, such as hugging or touching Touching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus, such as towels or washcloths Saliva, sweat, or tears that is NOT mixed with the blood of an infected person","Most infants born to HIV-positive women in the United States do not become HIV positive if the mother and infant have good prenatal and postpartum care that includes antiretroviral therapy (ART). Infants who are infected with HIV often have no symptoms for the first 2 to 3 months. Once symptoms develop, they can vary. Early symptoms may include: Yeast (candida) infections in the mouth Failure to gain weight and grow Swollen lymph glands Swollen salivary glands Enlarged spleen or liver Ear and sinus infections Upper respiratory tract infections Being slow to walk, crawl, or speak compared to healthy babies Diarrhea Early treatment often prevents the HIV infection from progressing. Without treatment, a child's immune system weakens over time, and infections that are uncommon in healthy children develop. These are severe infections in the body. They can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, or parasites. At this point, the illness has become full-blown AIDS.",,HIV infection - children; Human immunodeficiency virus - children; Acquired immune deficiency syndrome - children; Pregnancy - HIV; Maternal HIV; Perinatal - HIV
Hives,"Hives are raised, often itchy, red bumps (welts) on the surface of the skin. They can be an allergic reaction to food or medicine. They can also appear without cause.","When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction. People with other allergies, such as hay fever, often get hives. Angioedema is swelling of the deeper tissue that sometimes occurs with hives. Like hives, angioedema can occur on any part of the body. When it occurs around the mouth or throat, the symptoms can be severe, including airway blockage. Many substances can trigger hives, including: Animal dander (especially cats) Insect bites Medicines Pollen Shellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods Hives may also develop as a result of: Emotional stress Extreme cold or sun exposure Excessive perspiration Illness, including lupus , other autoimmune diseases , and leukemia Infections such as mononucleosis Exercise Exposure to water Often, the cause of hives is not known.","Symptoms of hives may include any of the following: Itching. Swelling of the surface of the skin into red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. Wheals may get bigger, spread, and join together to form larger areas of flat, raised skin. Wheals often change shape, disappear, and reappear within minutes or hours. It is unusual for a wheal to last more than 48 hours. Dermatographism, or skin writing, is a type of hives. It is caused by pressure on the skin and results in immediate hives in the area that has been pressed on or scratched.",,Urticaria - hives; Wheals

Vocal rest and time may improve hoarseness. Hoarseness that continues for more than 4 weeks should be checked by a health care provider. Things you can do at home to help relieve the problem include: Talk only when you need to until hoarseness goes away. Drink plenty of fluids to help keep your airways moist. (Gargling does not help.) Use a vaporizer to add moisture to the air you breathe. Avoid actions that strain the vocal cords such as whispering, shouting, crying, and singing. Take medicines to reduce stomach acid if hoarseness is due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Do not use decongestants which can dry out the vocal cords. If you smoke, cut down, or stop at least until hoarseness goes away.",Voice strain; Dysphonia; Loss of voice

The last two types also occur in animals. Hookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by weakening their immune system and increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off. There is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who are infected with hookworm. The larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one-half inch (1 centimeter) long. After traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which can result in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.","Symptoms may include: Abdominal discomfort Cough Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Gas Itchy rash Loss of appetite Nausea, vomiting Pale skin Most people have no symptoms once the worms enter the intestines.",,Hookworm disease; Ground itch; Ancylostoma duodenale infection; Necator americanus infection; Parasitic infection - hookworm

Sometimes, it can be fatal.","Pneumonia is a common illness. It is caused by many different germs. Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because: People in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs. The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community. Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a ventilator, which is a machine that helps them breathe. This is called ventilator-associated pneumonia. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands, clothes, or instruments from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing gowns, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital. People can be more likely to get pneumonia while in the hospital if they: Use alcohol excessively Have had chest surgery or other major surgery Have a weak immune system from cancer treatment, certain medicines, or severe wounds Have long-term (chronic) lung disease Breathe saliva or food into their lungs as a result of not being fully alert or having swallowing problems (for example, after a stroke) Are not mentally alert due to medicines or illness Are older Are on a breathing machine (ventilator)","In older adults, the first sign of hospital-acquired pneumonia may be mental changes or confusion.

The medical name of this condition is dorsocervical fat pad.,"Causes of dorsocervical fat pad include any of the following: Certain medicines used to treat HIV/AIDS Long-term use of certain glucocorticoid medicines, including prednisone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone Obesity (usually causes more generalized fat deposition) High level of the hormone cortisol (caused by Cushing syndrome ) Certain genetic disorders that cause unusual fat accumulation Madelung disease (multiple symmetrical lipomatosis) often associated with excess alcohol intake Osteoporosis may cause a curvature of the spine in the neck called kyphoscoliosis. This causes an abnormal shape but does not by itself cause excessive fat in the back of the neck.",,"If the hump is caused by a certain medicine, your provider may tell you to stop taking the medicine or change the dosage. Do not stop taking the medicine without first talking to your provider. Diet and exercise can help you lose weight and may relieve some fat accumulation due to obesity.",Buffalo hump; Dorsocervical fat pad
Huntington disease,"Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic disorder in which nerve cells in certain parts of the brain waste away, or degenerate. The disease is passed down through families.","HD is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome 4. The defect causes a part of your DNA to occur many more times than it is supposed to. This defect is called a CAG repeat. Normally, this section of DNA is repeated 10 to 28 times. But in people with HD, it is repeated 36 to 120 times. As the gene is passed down through families, the number of repeats tends to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the higher a person's chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, symptoms develop at younger and younger ages. There are two forms of HD: Adult-onset is the most common. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid-30s or 40s. Early-onset affects a small number of people and begins in childhood or the teens. If one of your parents has HD, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you get the gene from your parents, you can pass it on to your children, who will also have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you do not get the gene from your parents, you cannot pass the gene on to your children.","Abnormal behaviors may occur before movement problems develop, and can include: Behavioral disturbances Hallucinations Irritability Moodiness Restlessness or fidgeting Paranoia Psychosis Abnormal and unusual movements include: Facial movements, including grimaces Head turning to shift eye position Quick, sudden, sometimes wild jerking movements of the arms, legs, face, and other body parts Slow, uncontrolled movements Unsteady gait, including ""prancing"" and wide walk Abnormal movements can lead to falls.

Hydatidiform mole,Hydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD).,"HM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus. The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound, this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts. The chance of mole formation is higher in older women. A history of mole in earlier years is also a risk factor. Molar pregnancy can be of two types: Partial molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and some fetal development. Complete molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and no fetus. There is no way to prevent formation of these masses.","Symptoms of a molar pregnancy may include: Abnormal growth of the uterus, either bigger or smaller than usual Severe nausea and vomiting Vaginal bleeding during the first 3 months of pregnancy Symptoms of hyperthyroidism , including heat intolerance , loose stools , rapid heart rate , restlessness or nervousness, warm and moist skin, trembling hands , or unexplained weight loss Symptoms similar to preeclampsia that occur in the first trimester or early second trimester, including high blood pressure and swelling in the feet , ankles, and legs (this is almost always a sign of a hydatidiform mole, because preeclampsia is extremely rare this early in a normal pregnancy)",,Hydatid mole; Molar pregnancy; Hyperemesis - molar
Hydrocarbon pneumonia,"Hydrocarbon pneumonia is caused by drinking or breathing in gasoline, kerosene, furniture polish, paint thinner, or other oily materials or solvents. Many of these hydrocarbons are thin liquids.

Hydrocele,A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum.,"Hydroceles are common in newborn infants. During a baby's development in the womb, the testicles descend from the abdomen through a tube into the scrotum. Hydroceles occur when this tube does not close after the testicle moves through it. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube and gets trapped in the scrotum. This causes the scrotum to swell. Most hydroceles go away a few months after birth. Sometimes, a hydrocele may occur with an inguinal hernia . Hydroceles may also be caused by: Buildup of the normal fluid around the testicle. This may occur because the body makes too much of the fluid or it does not drain well. (This type of hydrocele is more common in older men.) Swelling or injury of the testicle or epididymis.","The main symptom is a painless, round-oval shaped swollen scrotum , which feels like a water balloon. A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides. However, the right side is more commonly involved.",,Processus vaginalis; Patent processus vaginalis

Hydrocephalus,Hydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to the brain pushing against the skull.,"Hydrocephalus is due to a problem with the flow of the fluid that surrounds the brain. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord and helps cushion the brain. CSF normally moves through the brain and around the spinal cord, and then is absorbed into the bloodstream. CSF levels in the brain can rise if: The flow of CSF is blocked. The fluid does not get properly absorbed into the blood. The brain makes too much of the fluid. Too much CSF puts pressure on the brain. This pushes the brain up against the skull and damages brain tissue. Hydrocephalus may begin while the baby is growing in the womb. It is common in babies who have a myelomeningocele , a birth defect in which the spinal column does not close properly. Hydrocephalus may also be due to: Genetic defects Certain infections during pregnancy In young children, hydrocephalus may be due to: Infections that affect the central nervous system (such as meningitis or encephalitis), especially in infants. Bleeding in the brain during or soon after delivery (especially in premature babies). Injury before, during, or after childbirth, including subarachnoid hemorrhage. Tumors of the central nervous system, including the brain or spinal cord. Injury or trauma. Hydrocephalus most often occurs in children. Another type, called normal pressure hydrocephalus , may occur in adults and older people.","Symptoms of hydrocephalus depend on: Age Amount of brain damage What is causing the buildup of CSF fluid In infants, hydrocephalus causes the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include: Eyes that appear to gaze downward Irritability Seizures Separated sutures Sleepiness Vomiting Symptoms that may occur in older children can include: Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements Difficulty feeding Excessive sleepiness Headache Irritability, poor temper control Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) Loss of coordination and trouble walking Muscle spasticity (spasm) Slow growth (child 0 to 5 years) Slow or restricted movement Vomiting",,Water on the brain

Hydrops fetalis,Hydrops fetalis is a serious condition. It occurs when abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of a fetus or newborn. It is a symptom of underlying problems.,"There are two types of hydrops fetalis, immune and nonimmune. The type depends on the cause of the abnormal fluid. Immune hydrops fetalis is most often a complication of a severe form of Rh incompatibility , which can be prevented. This is a condition in which mother who has Rh negative blood type makes antibodies to her baby's Rh positive blood cells, and the antibodies cross the placenta. Rh incompatibility causes a large number of red blood cells in the fetus to be destroyed (also known as hemolytic disease of the newborn ). This leads to problems including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis is more common. It accounts for up to 90% of cases of hydrops. The condition occurs when a disease or medical condition affects the body's ability to manage fluid. There are three main causes for this type, heart or lung problems, severe anemia (such as from thalassemia or infections), and genetic or developmental problems, including Turner syndrome . The number of babies who develop immune hydrops fetalis has dropped due to a medicine called RhoGAM. This drug is given as an injection to pregnant mothers who are at risk for Rh incompatibility. The drug prevents them from making antibodies against their babies' red blood cells. There are other, much rarer, blood group incompatibilities that can also cause immune hydrops fetalis, but RhoGAM does not help with these.",Symptoms depend on the severity of the condition. Mild forms may cause: Liver swelling Change in skin color (pallor) More severe forms may cause: Breathing problems Bruising or purplish bruise-like spots on the skin Heart failure Severe anemia Severe jaundice Total body swelling,,

Hypercalcemia,Hypercalcemia means you have too much calcium in your blood.,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D help manage calcium balance in the body. PTH is made by the parathyroid glands. These are four small glands located in the neck behind the thyroid gland. Vitamin D is obtained when the skin is exposed to sunlight, and from food sources or supplements. The most common cause of high calcium blood level is excess PTH released by the parathyroid glands. This excess occurs due to: An enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands. A growth on one of the glands. Most of the time, these growths are benign (not a cancer). Calcium blood level may also be high if your body is low on fluids or water. Other conditions can also cause hypercalcemia: Certain kinds of cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, or cancer that has spread to your organs. Too much vitamin D in your blood (hypervitaminosis D). Being immobile in bed for many days or weeks (mostly in children). Too much calcium in your diet. This is called milk-alkali syndrome. It most often occurs when a person is taking more than 2000 milligrams of calcium bicarbonate supplements a day along with high doses of Vitamin D. Overactive thyroid gland . Chronic kidney disease or kidney failure . Medicines such as thiazide diuretics (water pills) and lithium. Some infections or health problems such as, Paget disease, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. An inherited condition that affects the body's ability to manage calcium. Men and women of all ages can have a high blood calcium level. However, it is most common in women over age 50 (after menopause). In most cases, this is due to an overactive parathyroid gland.","The condition is most often diagnosed at an early stage using routine blood tests. Most people have no symptoms. Symptoms due to high calcium level may vary, depending on the cause and how long the problem has been present. They may include: Digestive symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, poor appetite, or constipation Increased thirst or more frequent urination, due to changes in the kidneys Muscle weakness or twitches Changes in how your brain works, such as feeling tired or fatigued or confused Bone pain and fragile bones that break more easily",,Calcium - elevated; High calcium level; Hyperparathyroidism - hypercalcemia
Hyperelastic skin,Hyperelastic skin is skin that can be stretched beyond what is considered normal. The skin returns to normal after it is stretched.,"Hyperelastic skin is most often seen in people who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People with this disorder have very elastic skin. They also have joints that can be bent more than is normally possible. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as rubber men or women. Other conditions that may cause skin that is easily stretched include: Marfan syndrome (genetic disorder of human connective tissue) Osteogenesis imperfecta (congenital bone disorder characterized by brittle bones) Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (rare genetic disorder that causes fragmentation and mineralization of elastic fibers in some tissues) Subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma (type of lymph system cancer that involves the skin) Sun-related changes of older skin",,"You need to take special steps to avoid skin damage when you have this condition because your skin is more delicate than normal. You are more likely to get cuts and scrapes, and scars may stretch and become more visible. Talk to your health care provider about what you can do for this problem. Get skin check-ups often. If you need surgery, discuss with your provider how the wound will be dressed and cared for after the procedure.",India rubber skin
Hyperemesis gravidarum,"Hyperemesis gravidarum is extreme, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It can lead to dehydration, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalances. Morning sickness is mild nausea and vomiting that occurs in early pregnancy.","Most women have some nausea or vomiting ( morning sickness ), particularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy. The exact cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is not known. However, it is believed to be caused by a rapidly rising blood level of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is released by the placenta. Mild morning sickness is common. Hyperemesis gravidarum is less common and more severe. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum have extreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It can cause a weight loss of more than 5% of body weight. The condition can happen in any pregnancy, but is a little more likely if you are pregnant with twins (or more babies), or if you have a hydatidiform mole . Women are at higher risk for hyperemesis if they have had the problem in previous pregnancies or are prone to motion sickness.","Morning sickness can cause decreased appetite, low level nausea, or vomiting. This is different from true hyperemesis because people are typically still able to eat and drink fluids some of the time. Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum are much more severe. They may include: Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy Salivating a lot more than normal Weight loss Signs of dehydration, such as dark urine, dry skin, weakness, lightheadedness, or fainting Constipation Inability to take in adequate amounts of fluid or nutrition",,Nausea - hyperemesis; Vomiting - hyperemesis; Morning sickness - hyperemesis; Pregnancy - hyperemesis
Hyperglycemia - infants,Hyperglycemia is abnormally high blood sugar. The medical term for blood sugar is blood glucose.,"A healthy baby's body most often has very careful control of the blood sugar level by normal bodily systems. Insulin is the main hormone in the body that regulates blood sugar. Sick babies may have poor insulin function or low amounts. This causes poor control of the blood sugar. There can be specific causes of ineffective insulin function or a low insulin level. Causes may include infection, liver problems, hormone problems, and some medicines. Rarely, babies may actually have diabetes, and therefore have a low insulin level that results in high blood sugar.","Babies with hyperglycemia often have no symptoms. Sometimes, babies with high blood sugar will produce large amounts of urine and become dehydrated. High blood sugar may be a sign that the baby has added stress on the body due to problems such as an infection or heart failure.",,High blood sugar - infants; High blood glucose level - infants
Hyperhidrosis,Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person sweats excessively and unpredictably. People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest.,"Sweating helps the body stay cool. In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid. Watch this video about: Sweating Excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. People with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional. When excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it is called focal hyperhidrosis. In most cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families. Sweating that is not caused by another disease is called primary hyperhidrosis. If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. The sweating may be all over the body (generalized) or it may be in one area (focal). Conditions that cause secondary hyperhidrosis include: Acromegaly Anxiety conditions Cancer Carcinoid syndrome Certain medicines and substances of abuse Glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia) Heart disease, such as heart attack Overactive thyroid Lung disease Menopause Parkinson disease Pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor) Spinal cord injury Stroke Tuberculosis or other infections",The primary symptom of hyperhidrosis is sweating.,,Sweating - excessive; Perspiration - excessive; Diaphoresis

Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome,"Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is a rare, genetic disease. It causes problems with the skin, sinuses, lungs, bones, and teeth.","Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and pustules . People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections. The symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made. Recent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the STAT3 gene on chromosome 17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood. However, people with the disease have a higher-than-normal level of a type of antibody called IgE.","Symptoms include: Bone and tooth defects, including fractures and losing the baby teeth late Eczema Skin abscesses and infection Repeated sinus infections Repeated lung infections",,Job syndrome; Hyper IgE syndrome
Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis,Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperPP) is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a higher than normal level of potassium in the blood. The medical name for high potassium level is hyperkalemia.,"HyperPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected. Occasionally, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited. It is believed that the disorder is related to problems with the way the body controls sodium and potassium levels in cells. Risk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis. It affects men and women equally.","Symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement ( paralysis ) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks. Attacks usually begin in childhood. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have several attacks a day. They are usually not severe enough to need therapy. Some people have associated myotonia , in which they cannot immediately relax their muscles after use. The weakness or paralysis: Most commonly occurs at the shoulders, back, and hips May also involve the arms and legs, but does not affect muscles of the eyes and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing Most commonly occurs while resting after activity or exercise May occur on awakening Occurs on and off Usually lasts 15 minutes to 1 hour, but may last up to an entire day Triggers may include: Eating a high carbohydrate meal Rest after exercise Exposure to cold Skipping meals Eating potassium-rich foods or taking medicines that contain potassium Stress",,Periodic paralysis - hyperkalemic; Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis; HyperKPP; HyperPP; Gamstorp disease; Potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis
Hypermobile joints,"Hypermobile joints are joints that move beyond the normal range with little effort. Joints most commonly affected are the elbows, wrists, fingers, and knees.",Hypermobile joints often occur in otherwise healthy and normal children. This is called benign hypermobility syndrome. Rare medical conditions associated with hypermobile joints include: Cleidocranial dysostosis (abnormal development of bones in the skull and clavicle) Down syndrome (genetic condition in which a person has 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (group of inherited disorders marked by extremely loose joints) Marfan syndrome (connective tissue disorder) Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (disorder in which body is missing or doesn't have enough of a substance needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules),,There is no specific care for this condition. People with hypermobile joints have an increased risk for joint dislocation and other problems. Extra care may be needed to protect the joints. Ask your health care provider for recommendations.,Joint hypermobility; Loose joints; Hypermobility syndrome
Hyperparathyroidism,Hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which 1 or more of the parathyroid glands in your neck produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH).,"There are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones. When the blood calcium level is too low, the body responds by making more PTH. This causes the calcium level in the blood to rise. If one or more of the parathyroid glands grow larger, it may lead to too much PTH. Most often, the cause is a benign tumor of the parathyroid glands ( parathyroid adenoma ). These benign tumors are common and happen without a known cause. The disease is most common in people over age 60, but it can also occur in younger adults. Hyperparathyroidism in childhood is very unusual. Women are more likely to be affected than men. Radiation to the head and neck increases the risk. Some genetic syndromes ( multiple endocrine neoplasia I ) make it more likely to have hyperparathyroidism. In very rare cases, hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid cancer . Medical conditions that cause low blood calcium or increased phosphate can also lead to hyperparathyroidism. Common conditions include: Conditions that make it hard for the body to remove phosphate Kidney damage or failure Not enough calcium in the diet Too much calcium lost in the urine Vitamin D disorders (may occur in children who do not eat a variety of foods, and in older adults who do not get enough sunlight on their skin or who have poor absorption of vitamin D from food such as after bariatric surgery) Problems absorbing nutrients from food","Hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed by common blood tests before symptoms occur. Symptoms are mostly caused by damage to organs from high calcium level in the blood, or by the loss of calcium from the bones. Symptoms can include: Bone pain or tenderness Depression and forgetfulness Feeling tired, ill, and weak Fragile bones of the limbs and spine that can break easily Increased amount of urine produced and needing to urinate more often Kidney stones Nausea and loss of appetite",,Parathyroid-related hypercalcemia; Osteoporosis - hyperparathyroidism; Bone thinning - hyperparathyroidism; Osteopenia - hyperparathyroidism; High calcium level - hyperparathyroidism; Chronic kidney disease - hyperparathyroidism; Kidney failure - hyperparathyroidism; Overactive parathyroid; Vitamin D deficiency - hyperparathyroidism

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs due to breathing in dust, fungus, molds, or other substances.","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually occurs in people who work in places where there are high levels of dust, fungus, or molds. Long-term exposure can lead to lung inflammation and acute lung disease . Over time, the acute condition turns into long-lasting (chronic) lung disease. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be caused by: Fungi or bacteria in humidifiers, heating systems, and air conditioners found in homes and offices Exposure to certain chemicals, such as isocyanates or acid anhydrides Examples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include: Bird fancier's lung is caused by exposure to proteins found in the feathers or droppings of many species of birds. This is the most common type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Farmer's lung is caused by exposure to dust from moldy hay, straw, and grain.","Symptoms often occur 4 to 8 hours after you have left the area where the triggering substance is found. This makes it hard to figure out what has caused the disease. Your symptoms may get better before you go back to the area where you were exposed to the substance. In the chronic phase of the condition, the symptoms are more constant and less affected by exposure to the substance. Symptoms after acute exposure may include: Chills Cough Fever Malaise (feeling ill) Shortness of breath Symptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include: Breathlessness, especially with activity Cough, often dry Loss of appetite Unintentional weight loss",,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis; Farmer's lung; Mushroom picker's disease; Humidifier or air-conditioner lung; Bird breeder's or bird fancier's lung
Hypersensitivity vasculitis,"Hypersensitivity vasculitis is an extreme reaction to a drug, infection, or foreign substance. It leads to inflammation and damage to blood vessels, mainly in the skin. The term is not used much currently because more specific names are considered more precise.","Hypersensitivity vasculitis, or cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, is caused by: An allergic reaction to a drug or other foreign substance A reaction to an infection It usually affects people older than age 16. Often, the cause of the problem cannot be found even with a careful study of the person's medical history. Hypersensitivity vasculitis may look like systemic, necrotizing vasculitis , which can affect blood vessels throughout the body and not just in the skin. In children, it can look like Henoch-Schonlein purpura.","Symptoms may include: New rash with tender, purple or brownish-red spots over large areas Skin sores mostly located on the legs, buttocks, or trunk Blisters on the skin Hives ( urticaria ), may last longer than 24 hours Open sores with dead tissue (necrotic ulcers )",,Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis; Allergic vasculitis; Leukocytoclastic vasculitis
Hypersplenism,"Hypersplenism is an overactive spleen. The spleen is an organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen. The spleen helps filter old and damaged cells from your bloodstream. If your spleen is overactive, it removes the blood cells too early and too quickly. An overactive spleen is often, but not always, enlarged (splenomegaly).",Common causes of hypersplenism include: Cirrhosis (advanced liver disease) Lymphoma Malaria Tuberculosis Various connective tissue and inflammatory diseases,Symptoms include: Enlarged spleen Low level of one or more types of blood cells Feeling full too soon after eating Stomach pain on the left side,,
Hypertensive heart disease,Hypertensive heart disease refers to heart problems that occur because of high blood pressure that is present over a long time.,"High blood pressure means the pressure inside the blood vessels (called arteries) is too high. As the heart pumps against this pressure, it must work harder. Over time, this causes the heart muscle to thicken. Because there are often no symptoms with high blood pressure, people can have the problem without knowing it. Symptoms most often do not occur until after many years of poor blood pressure control, when damage to the heart has occurred. Eventually, the muscle may become so thick that it does not get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain). Without appropriate blood pressure control, the heart muscle can weaken over time and heart failure may develop. High blood pressure also leads to thickening of the blood vessel walls. When combined with cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels, the risk of heart attack and stroke increases. Hypertensive heart disease is the leading cause of illness and death from high blood pressure.",,,Hypertension - hypertensive heart; High blood pressure - hypertensive heart
Hyperthyroidism,Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. The condition is often called overactive thyroid.,"The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism . Many diseases and conditions can cause hyperthyroidism, including: Graves disease (most common cause of hyperthyroidism) Inflammation (thyroiditis) of the thyroid due to viral infections, some medicines, or after pregnancy (common) Taking too much thyroid hormone (common) Noncancerous growths of the thyroid gland or pituitary gland (rare) Some tumors of the testes or ovaries (rare) Getting medical imaging tests with contrast dye that has iodine (rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid) Eating too much of foods that contain iodine (very rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)","Common symptoms include: Anxiety Difficulty concentrating Fatigue Frequent bowel movements Goiter (visibly enlarged thyroid gland) or thyroid nodules Hair loss Hand tremor Heat intolerance Increased appetite Increased sweating Irregular menstrual periods in women Nail changes (thickness or flaking) Nervousness Pounding or racing heart beat ( palpitations ) Restlessness Sleep problems Weight loss (or weight gain, in some cases) Other symptoms that can occur with this condition: Breast development in men Clammy skin Diarrhea Feeling faint when you raise your hands High blood pressure Itchy or irritated eyes Itchy skin Nausea and vomiting Protruding eyes (exophthalmos) Skin blushing or flushing Skin rash on the shins Weakness of the hips and shoulders",,Thyrotoxicosis; Overactive thyroid; Graves disease - hyperthyroidism; Thyroiditis - hyperthyroidism; Toxic goiter - hyperthyroidism; Thyroid nodules - hyperthyroidism; Thyroid hormone - hyperthyroidism
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Sometimes, only one part of the heart is thicker than the other parts.","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families (inherited). It is thought to result from defects in the genes that control heart muscle growth. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the condition is seen in people of all ages.","Some people with the condition may have no symptoms. They may first find out they have the problem during a routine medical exam. In many young adults, the first symptom of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sudden collapse and possible death. This can be caused by highly abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ). It may also be due to a blockage that prevents the outflow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Common symptoms include: Chest pain Dizziness Fainting , especially during exercise Fatigue Lightheadedness, especially with or after activity or exercise Sensation of feeling the heart beat fast or irregularly ( palpitations ) Shortness of breath with activity or after lying down (or being asleep for a while)",,Cardiomyopathy - hypertrophic (HCM); IHSS; Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis; Asymmetric septal hypertrophy; ASH; HOCM; Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
Hyperventilation,"Hyperventilation is rapid and deep breathing. It is also called overbreathing, and it may leave you feeling breathless.","Emotional causes include: Anxiety and nervousness Panic attack Situations where there is a psychological advantage in having a sudden, dramatic illness (for example, somatization disorder ) Stress Medical causes include: Bleeding Heart problem such as heart failure or heart attack Drugs (such as an aspirin overdose ) Infection such as pneumonia or sepsis Ketoacidosis and other medical conditions causing excess acid production in the body Lung disease such as asthma , COPD , or pulmonary embolism Pregnancy Severe pain Stimulant medicines",,"Your provider will examine you for other causes of your overbreathing. If your provider has said your hyperventilation is due to anxiety, stress, or panic, there are steps you can take at home. You, your friends, and family can learn techniques to stop it from happening and prevent future attacks. If you start hyperventilating, the goal is to raise the carbon dioxide level in your blood. This will end most of your symptoms. Ways to do this include: Get reassurance from a friend or family member to help relax your breathing. Words like ""you are doing fine,"" ""you are not having a heart attack,"" and ""you are not going to die"" are very helpful. It's very important that the person stays calm and uses a soft, relaxed tone. To help get rid of carbon dioxide, learn to do pursed lip breathing . This is done by puckering your lips as if you're blowing out a candle, then breathing out slowly through your lips. If you have been diagnosed with anxiety or panic, see a mental health professional to help you understand and treat your condition. Learn breathing exercises that help you relax and breathe from your diaphragm and abdomen, rather than from your chest wall. Practice relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or meditation. Exercise regularly. If these methods alone don't prevent overbreathing, your provider may recommend medicine.",Rapid deep breathing; Breathing - rapid and deep; Overbreathing; Fast deep breathing; Respiratory rate - rapid and deep; Hyperventilation syndrome; Panic attack - hyperventilation; Anxiety - hyperventilation
Hypervitaminosis A,Hypervitaminosis A is a disorder in which there is too much vitamin A in the body.,"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored in the liver. Many foods contain vitamin A, including: Meat, fish, and egg yolks Dairy products Some fruits and vegetables Some dietary supplements also contain vitamin A. Taking too many supplements is the most common cause of vitamin A toxicity. It tends not to occur just from eating vitamin A-rich foods. Too much vitamin A can make you sick. Taking large doses during pregnancy can cause birth defects. Acute vitamin A poisoning occurs quickly. It can happen when an adult takes several hundred thousand international units (IUs) of vitamin A. Chronic vitamin A poisoning may occur over time in adults who regularly take more than 25,000 IUs a day. Babies and children are more sensitive to vitamin A. They can become sick after taking smaller doses of it. Swallowing products that contain vitamin A, such as skin cream with retinol in it, can also cause vitamin A poisoning.","Symptoms may include: Abnormal softening of the skull bone (in infants and children) Blurred vision Bone pain or swelling Bulging of the soft spot in an infant's skull ( fontanelle ) Changes in alertness or consciousness Decreased appetite Dizziness Double vision (in young children) Drowsiness Hair changes, such as hair loss and oily hair Headache Irritability Liver damage Nausea and vomiting Poor weight gain (in infants and children) Skin changes, such as cracking at corners of the mouth, higher sensitivity to sunlight, oily skin, peeling, itching, and yellow color to the skin Vision changes",,Vitamin A toxicity
Hypervitaminosis D,Hypervitaminosis D is a condition that occurs after taking very high doses of vitamin D.,"The cause is excess intake of vitamin D. The doses need to be very high, far above what most health care providers normally prescribe. There has been a lot of confusion about vitamin D supplementation. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is between 400 and 800 IU/day, according to age and pregnancy status. Higher doses may be needed for some people, such as those with vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other conditions. However, most people do not need more than 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day. For most people, vitamin D toxicity only occurs with vitamin D doses above 10,000 IU per day.","An excess of vitamin D can cause an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood ( hypercalcemia ). This can severely damage the kidneys, soft tissues, and bones over time. The symptoms include: Constipation Decreased appetite (anorexia) Dehydration Fatigue and confusion Frequent urination Irritability Muscle weakness Vomiting Excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) High blood pressure Passing large amounts of urine ( polyuria )",,Vitamin D toxicity
Hyphema,Hyphema is blood in the front area (anterior chamber) of the eye. The blood collects behind the cornea and in front of the iris.,Hyphema is most often caused by trauma to the eye. Other causes of bleeding in the front chamber of the eye include: Blood vessel abnormality Cancer of the eye Severe inflammation of the iris Advanced diabetes Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia,"Symptoms include: Bleeding in the anterior chamber of the eye Eye pain Light sensitivity Vision abnormalities You may not be able to see a small hyphema when looking at your eye in the mirror. With a total hyphema, the collection of blood will block the view of the iris and pupil.",,
Hypochromia,Hypochromia means that the red blood cells have less color than normal when examined under a microscope. This usually occurs when there is not enough of the pigment that carries oxygen (hemoglobin) in the red blood cells.,,,,
Hypogonadism,"Hypogonadism occurs when the body's sex glands (gonads) produce little or no hormones. In men, these glands are the testes. In women, these glands are the ovaries.","The cause of hypogonadism can be primary (testes or ovaries) or secondary (problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus). In primary hypogonadism, the ovaries or testes themselves do not function properly. Causes of primary hypogonadism include: Certain autoimmune disorders Genetic and developmental disorders Infection Iron excess (hemochromatosis) Liver and kidney disease Radiation (to the gonads) Surgery Trauma The most common genetic disorders that cause primary hypogonadism are Turner syndrome (in women) and Klinefelter syndrome (in men). If you already have other autoimmune disorders you may be at higher risk for autoimmune damage to the gonads. These can include disorders that affect the liver, adrenal glands, and thyroid glands, as well as type 1 diabetes. In central hypogonadism, the centers in the brain that control the gonads (hypothalamus and pituitary) do not function properly. Causes of central hypogonadism include: Anorexia nervosa Bleeding in the area of the pituitary Taking medicines, such as glucocorticoids and opiates Stopping anabolic steroids Genetic problems Infections Nutritional deficiencies Iron excess ( hemochromatosis ) Radiation (to the pituitary or hypothalamus) Rapid, significant weight loss (including weight loss after bariatric surgery) Surgery (skull base surgery near the pituitary) Trauma Tumors A genetic cause of central hypogonadism is Kallmann syndrome . Many people with this condition also have a decreased sense of smell. Menopause is the most common reason for hypogonadism. It is normal in all women and occurs on average around age 50. Testosterone levels decrease in men as they age, as well. The range of normal testosterone in the blood is much lower in a 50 to 60 year-old man than it is in a 20 to 30 year-old man.","Girls who have hypogonadism will not begin menstruating. Hypogonadism can affect their breast development and height. If hypogonadism occurs after puberty, symptoms in women include: Hot flashes Energy and mood changes Menstruation becomes irregular or stops In boys, hypogonadism affects muscle, beard, genital and voice development. It also leads to growth problems. In men the symptoms are: Breast enlargement Muscle loss Decreased interest in sex (low libido) If a pituitary or other brain tumor is present (central hypogonadism), there may be: Headaches or vision loss Milky breast discharge (from a prolactinoma, a tumor that produces the hormone prolactin) Symptoms of other hormonal deficiencies (such as hypothyroidism ) The most common tumors affecting the pituitary are craniopharyngioma in children and prolactinoma adenomas in adults.",,Gonadal deficiency; Testicular failure; Ovarian failure; Testosterone - hypogonadism
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,Hypogonadism is a condition in which the male testes or the female ovaries produce little or no sex hormones.,"HH is caused by a lack of hormones that normally stimulate the ovaries or testes. These hormones include: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Normally: The hypothalamus in the brain releases GnRH. This hormone stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. These hormones tell the female ovaries or the male testes to release hormones that lead to normal sexual development in puberty, normal menstrual cycles, estrogen levels and fertility in adult women, and normal testosterone production and sperm production in adult men. Any change in this hormone release chain causes a lack of sex hormones. This prevents normal sexual maturity in children and normal function of the testicles or ovaries in adults. There are several causes of HH: Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus from surgery, injury, tumor, infection, or radiation Genetic defects High doses or long-term use of opioid or steroid (glucocorticoid) medicines High prolactin level (a different hormone released by the pituitary) Severe stress Nutritional problems (both rapid weight gain or weight loss) Long-term (chronic) medical diseases, including chronic inflammation or infections Drug use, such as heroin or use or abuse of prescription opioid medicines Certain medical conditions, such as iron overload Kallmann syndrome is an inherited form of HH. Some people with this condition also lose their sense of smell (anosmia).","Children: Lack of growth and sexual development at the standard age for puberty (development may be very late or incomplete) In girls, a lack of breast development and menstrual periods In boys, no development of sex characteristics, such as enlargement of the testes and penis, deepening of the voice, and facial hair Inability to smell (in some cases) Short stature (in some cases) Adults: Loss of interest in sex (libido) in men Loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) in women Decreased energy and interest in activities Loss of muscle mass in men Weight gain Mood changes Infertility",,Gonadotropin deficiency; Secondary hypogonadism
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis,Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood. The medical name for low potassium level is hypokalemia.,"HypoPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected. In some cases, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited. Unlike other forms of periodic paralysis, people with hypoPP have normal thyroid function. But they have a very low blood level of potassium during episodes of weakness. This results from potassium moving from the blood into muscle cells in an abnormal way. Risk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis. The risk is slightly higher in Asian men who also have thyroid disorders.","Symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement ( paralysis ) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks. Attacks usually begin in the teen years, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year. During attacks the person remains alert. The weakness or paralysis: Most commonly occurs at the shoulders and hips May also affect the arms, legs, muscles of the eyes, and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing Occurs off and on Most commonly occurs on awakening or after sleep or rest Is rare during exercise, but may be triggered by resting after exercise May be triggered by high-carbohydrate, high-salt meals, stress, pregnancy, heavy exercise, and cold An attack usually lasts for several hours up to a day Another symptom may include eyelid myotonia (a condition in which after opening and closing the eyes, they cannot be opened for a short time).",,Periodic paralysis - hypokalemic; Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis; HOKPP; HypoKPP; HypoPP
Hypomelanosis of Ito,"Hypomelanosis of Ito (HMI) is a very rare birth defect that causes unusual patches of light-colored (hypopigmented) skin and may be associated with eye, nervous system, and skeletal problems.","Health care providers do not know the exact cause of HMI, but they believe it may involve a genetic condition called mosaicism. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.","Skin symptoms are most often visible by the time a child is about 2 years old. Other symptoms develop as the child grows, and may include: Crossed eyes (strabismus) Hearing problems Increased body hair ( hirsutism ) Scoliosis Seizures Streaked, whorled or mottled patches of skin on the arms, legs, and middle of the body Intellectual disability, including autism spectrum disorder and learning disability Mouth or tooth problems",,Incontinentia pigmenti achromians; HMI; Ito hypomelanosis
Hypoparathyroidism,Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone (PTH).,"There are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, located near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones. Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the glands produce too little PTH. The blood calcium level falls, and the phosphorus level rises. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is injury to the parathyroid glands during thyroid or neck surgery. It may also be caused by any of the following: Autoimmune attack on the parathyroid glands (common) Very low magnesium level in the blood (reversible) Radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism (very rare) DiGeorge syndrome is a disease in which hypoparathyroidism occurs because all the parathyroid glands are missing at birth. This disease includes other health problems besides hypoparathyroidism. It is usually diagnosed in childhood. Familial hypoparathyroidism occurs with other endocrine diseases such as adrenal insufficiency in a syndrome called type I polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I).","Onset of the disease is very gradual and symptoms can be mild. Many people diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism have had symptoms for years before they are diagnosed. Symptoms may be so mild that the diagnosis is made after a screening blood test that shows low calcium. Symptoms may include any of the following: Tingling lips, fingers, and toes (most common) Muscle cramps (most common) Muscle spasms called tetany (can affect the larynx, causing breathing difficulties) Abdominal pain Abnormal heart rhythm Brittle nails Cataracts Calcium deposits in some tissues Decreased consciousness Dry hair Dry, scaly skin Pain in the face , legs, and feet Painful menstruation Seizures Teeth that do not grow in on time, or at all Weakened tooth enamel (in children)",,Parathyroid-related hypocalcemia
Hypophosphatemia,Hypophosphatemia is a low level of phosphorus (phosphate) in the blood.,"The following may cause hypophosphatemia: Alcoholism Antacids Certain medicines, including insulin, acetazolamide, foscarnet, imatinib, intravenous iron, niacin, pentamidine, sorafenib, and tenofovir Fanconi syndrome Fat malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract Hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid gland) Starvation Too little vitamin D",Symptoms may include: Bone pain Confusion Muscle weakness Seizures,,Low blood phosphate; Phosphate - low; Hyperparathyroidism - low phosphate
Hypopituitarism,Hypopituitarism is a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones.,"The pituitary gland is a small structure that is located just below the brain. It is attached by a stalk to the hypothalamus . The hypothalamus is the area of the brain that controls the pituitary gland's function. The hormones released by the pituitary gland (and their functions) are: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -- stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol; cortisol helps to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -- controls water loss by the kidneys Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females Growth hormone (GH) -- stimulates growth of tissues and bone Luteinizing hormone (LH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females Oxytocin -- stimulates the uterus to contract during labor and the breasts to release milk Prolactin -- stimulates female breast development and milk production Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) -- stimulates the thyroid gland to release hormones that affect the body's metabolism Watch this video about: Pituitary gland In hypopituitarism, there is a lack of one or more pituitary hormones. Lack of a hormone leads to loss of function in the gland or organ the hormone controls. For example, lack of TSH leads to loss of normal function of the thyroid gland. Hypopituitarism may be caused by: Brain surgery Brain tumor Head trauma (traumatic brain injury) Infections or inflammation of the brain and the tissues that support the brain Death of an area of tissue in the pituitary gland ( pituitary apoplexy ) Radiation therapy to the brain Stroke (rare) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (from a burst aneurysm) Tumors of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus Sometimes, hypopituitarism is due to uncommon immune system or metabolic diseases, such as: Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) Abnormal increase in immune cells called histiocytes ( histiocytoses ) Autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the pituitary (lymphocytic hypophysitis) Sarcoidosis , a condition that causes inflammation of various tissues and organs Infections of the pituitary, such as primary pituitary tuberculosis Hypopituitarism is also a rare complication caused by severe bleeding during pregnancy. The loss of blood leads to tissue death in the pituitary gland. This condition is called Sheehan syndrome . Certain medicines can also suppress pituitary function. The most common medicines are glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone), which are taken for inflammatory and immune conditions. Medicines used to treat prostate cancer can also lead to low pituitary function.","Symptoms of hypopituitarism include any of the following (multiple symptoms are common): Abdominal pain Decreased appetite Lack of sex drive (libido) in men or women Dizziness or fainting Erection problems Excessive urination and thirst (including frequent urination at night) Failure to release milk (in women) Fatigue , weakness Headache Infertility Irregular or absent menstrual periods Loss of armpit or pubic hair Loss of the body or facial hair (in men) Low blood pressure Low blood sugar Sensitivity to cold Short height (less than 5 feet or 1.5 meters) if onset is during the childhood growth period Slowed growth and sexual development (in children) Vision problems Weight loss Symptoms may develop slowly and may vary greatly, depending upon: The number of hormones that are missing and the organs they affect The severity of the disorder Other symptoms that may occur with this condition: Face swelling Hair loss Hoarseness or changing voice Joint stiffness Weight gain",,Pituitary insufficiency; Panhypopituitarism
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).","Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10% of babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects. It is also associated with some genetic diseases such as Turner syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, trisomy 13 and 18. The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the: Aorta (the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body) Entrance and exit of the ventricle Mitral and aortic valves This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal. In babies with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail. The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two of these connections: Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium) Ductus arteriosus (a small blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery) Both connections normally close on their own a few days after birth. In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood leaving the right side of the heart through the pulmonary artery travels through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Babies with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).","At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms may occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include: Bluish color to the skin ( cyanosis ) due to low oxygen level in the blood Cold hands and feet (extremities) Lethargy Poor pulse Poor suckling and feeding Pounding heart Rapid breathing Shortness of breath In healthy newborns, bluish color in the hands and feet is a response to cold (this reaction is called peripheral cyanosis). A bluish color in the chest or abdomen, lips, and tongue is abnormal (called central cyanosis). It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying.",,HLHS; Congenital heart - hypoplastic left heart; Cyanotic heart disease - hypoplastic left heart
Hypospadias,"Hypospadias is a birth (congenital) defect in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis. The urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and outside the body. In males, the opening of the urethra is normally at the end of the penis.","Hypospadias occurs in about 1 in 200 newborn boys in the United States. The cause is often unknown. Certain factors may be associated with the condition, such as: Family history Genetic factors that affect how the urethra develops Maternal age over 35 Maternal overweight or obesity Premature birth Low birth weight Other factors may also play a role: Exposure to certain hormones Exposure to substances in the environment","Symptoms depend on how severe the problem is. Most often, boys with this condition have the opening of the urethra near the tip of the penis on the underside. More severe forms of hypospadias occur when the opening is in the middle or base of the penis. Rarely, the opening is located in or behind the scrotum. This condition may cause the penis to curve down during an erection. Erections are common in infant boys. Other symptoms include: Problems peeing without it spraying to the side or down (this can make it difficult to urinate while standing) Foreskin that makes the penis looks like it has a ""hood"" Some boys with hypospadias have one or both testicles that have not moved down into the scrotum (undescended testicle).",,
Hypospadias repair,"Hypospadias repair is surgery to correct a defect in the opening of the penis that is present at birth. The urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) does not end at the tip of the penis. Instead, it ends on the underside of the penis. In more severe cases, the urethra opens at the middle or bottom of the penis, or in or behind the scrotum.",,,,Urethroplasty; Meatoplasty; Glanuloplasty
Hypothalamic dysfunction,Hypothalamic dysfunction is a problem with part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus helps control the pituitary gland and regulates many body functions.,"The hypothalamus helps keep the body's internal functions in balance. It helps regulate: Appetite and weight Body temperature Childbirth Emotions, behavior, memory Growth Production of breast milk Salt and water balance Sex drive Sleep-wake cycle and the body clock Another important function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It lies just below the hypothalamus. The pituitary, in turn, controls the: Adrenal glands Ovaries Testes Thyroid gland There are many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction. The most common are: Surgery Brain injury Brain tumors Radiation treatment to the brain Other causes include: Nutrition problems, such as eating disorders ( anorexia ), extreme weight loss Blood vessel problems in the brain, such as aneurysm , pituitary apoplexy , subarachnoid hemorrhage Genetic disorders, such as Prader-Willi syndrome , familial diabetes insipidus , Kallmann syndrome Infections and swelling (inflammation) due to certain immune system diseases","Symptoms are usually due to the hormones or brain signals that are missing. In children, there may be growth problems, either too much or too little growth. In other children, puberty occurs too early or too late. Tumor symptoms may include headache or loss of vision. If the thyroid is affected, there may be symptoms of an underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ). Symptoms may include feeling cold all the time, constipation, fatigue , or weight gain , among others. If the adrenal glands are affected, there may be symptoms of low adrenal function. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, weight loss, and lack of interest in activities.",,Hypothalamic syndromes
Hypothalamic tumor,"A hypothalamic tumor is an abnormal growth in the hypothalamus gland, which is located in the brain.","The exact cause of hypothalamic tumors is not known. It is likely that they result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In children, most hypothalamic tumors are gliomas. Gliomas are a common type of brain tumor that result from the abnormal growth of glial cells, which support nerve cells. Gliomas can occur at any age. They are often more aggressive in adults than in children. In adults, tumors in the hypothalamus are more likely cancer that has spread from another organ. People with neurofibromatosis (a hereditary condition) are at increased risk for this type of tumor. People who have undergone radiation therapy are at increased risk of developing tumors in general.","These tumors can cause a range of symptoms: Euphoric ""high"" sensations Failure to thrive (lack of normal growth in children) Headache Hyperactivity Loss of body fat and appetite (cachexia) These symptoms are most often seen in children whose tumors affect the front part of the hypothalamus. Some tumors may cause vision loss. If the tumors block the flow of spinal fluid, headaches and sleepiness may result from fluid collecting in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). Some people can have seizures as a result of brain tumors. Other people may develop precocious puberty from a change in pituitary gland function.",,Hypothalamic glioma; Hypothalamus - tumor

IgA nephropathy,"IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder in which antibodies (called IgA) build up in kidney tissue. Nephropathy is damage, disease, or other problems with the kidney.","IgA is a protein, called an antibody , that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged. The disorder can appear suddenly ( acute ), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic glomerulonephritis ). Risk factors include: A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-Schönlein purpura , a form of vasculitis that affects many parts of the body White or Asian ethnicity IgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.","There may be no symptoms for many years.

Illness anxiety disorder,"Illness anxiety disorder (IAD) is a preoccupation that physical symptoms are signs of a serious illness, even when there is no medical evidence to support the presence of an illness.","People with IAD are overly focused on, and always thinking about, their physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having or developing a serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women. The way people with IAD think about their physical symptoms can make them more likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be hard to stop. It is important to realize that people with IAD do not purposely create these symptoms. They aren't able to control the symptoms. People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have IAD. But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse.","People with IAD can't control their fears and worries. They often believe any symptom or sensation is a sign of a serious illness. They seek out reassurance from family, friends, or health care providers on a regular basis. They feel better for a short time and then begin to worry about the same symptoms or new symptoms. Symptoms may shift and change, and are often vague. People with IAD often examine their own body. Some may realize that their fear is unreasonable or unfounded. IAD is different from somatic symptom disorder .

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder in which the immune system destroys platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. People with the disease have too few platelets in the blood.","ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce antibodies against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels. The antibodies attach to the platelets. The body destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies. In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a long-term (chronic) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain medicines, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder. ITP affects women more often than men. It is more common in children than adults. In children, the disease affects boys and girls equally.","ITP symptoms can include any of the following: Abnormally heavy periods in women Bleeding into the skin , often around the shins, causing a skin rash that looks like pinpoint red spots (petechial rash) Easy bruising Nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth",,ITP; Immune thrombocytopenia; Bleeding disorder - idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; Bleeding disorder - ITP; Autoimmune - ITP; Low platelet count - ITP
Immunodeficiency disorders,Immunodeficiency disorders occur when the body's immune response is reduced or absent.,"The immune system is made up of lymphoid tissue in the body, which includes: Bone marrow Lymph nodes Parts of the spleen and gastrointestinal tract Thymus Tonsils Proteins and cells in the blood are also part of the immune system. The immune system helps protect the body from harmful substances called antigens . Examples of antigens include bacteria, viruses, toxins , cancer cells, and foreign blood or tissues from another person or species. Watch this video about: Immune response When the immune system detects an antigen, it responds by activating cells known as T lymphocytes, which interact with cells known as B lymphocytes. The B cells lead to production of proteins called antibodies that destroy the harmful substances. The immune system response also involves a process called phagocytosis. During this process, certain white blood cells swallow and destroy bacteria and other foreign substances. Proteins called complement help with this process. Watch this video about: Phagocytosis Immunodeficiency disorders may affect any part of the immune system. Most often, these conditions occur when the T or B lymphocytes (or both) do not function normally or your body does not produce enough antibodies. Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include: Hypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections Agammaglobulinemia , which results in severe infections early in life, and is often deadly Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect T cells may cause repeated Candida (yeast) infections. Inherited combined immunodeficiency affects both T cells and B cells. It may be deadly within the first year of life if it isn't treated early. People are said to be immunosuppressed when they have an immunodeficiency disorder due to medicines that weaken the immune system. Examples include: Corticosteroids Medicines used to treat health problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain skin conditions Chemotherapy given to treat cancer Acquired immunodeficiency may be a complication of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malnutrition (especially if the person does not eat enough protein). Many cancers may also cause immunodeficiency. People who have had their spleen removed have an acquired immunodeficiency, and are at higher risk for infection by certain bacteria that the spleen would normally help fight. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for certain infections. As you get older, the immune system becomes less effective. Immune system tissues (especially lymphoid tissue such as the thymus) shrink, and the number and activity of white blood cells drop. The following are diseases of the immune system that can prevent it from functioning normally: Ataxia-telangiectasia Complement deficiencies DiGeorge syndrome Hypogammaglobulinemia Job syndrome or Hyper IgE syndrome Leukocyte adhesion defects Agammaglobulinemia Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Comon variable immunodeficiency Severe variable immunodeficiency","Your health care provider might think you have an immunodeficiency disorder if you have: Infections that keep coming back or do not go away Severe infection from bacteria or other germs that do not usually cause severe infection Other signs include: Poor response to treatment for infections Delayed or incomplete recovery from illness Certain types of cancers (such as Kaposi sarcoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma) Certain infections (including some forms of pneumonia or repeated yeast infections) Symptoms depend on the disorder. For example, those with decreased levels of IgA combined with low levels of certain IgG subclasses are likely to have problems involving the lungs, sinuses, ears, throat, and digestive tract. People with disorders of their T cells also may be more likely to develop severe fungal infections.",,Immunosuppression; Immunodepressed - immunodeficiency; Immunosuppressed - immunodeficiency; Hypogammaglobulinemia - immunodeficiency; Agammaglobulinemia - immunodeficiency

Impacted tooth,An impacted tooth is a tooth that does not break through the gum.,"Teeth start to pass through the gums (emerge) during infancy. This happens again when permanent teeth replace the primary (baby) teeth. If a tooth does not come in, or emerges only partially, it is considered to be impacted. This most commonly happens with the wisdom teeth (the third set of molars). They are the last teeth to erupt. They usually come in between the ages of 17 and 21. An impacted tooth remains stuck in gum tissue or bone for various reasons. The area may be overcrowded, leaving no room for the teeth to emerge. For example, the jaw may be too small to fit the wisdom teeth. Teeth may also become twisted, tilted, or displaced as they try to emerge. This results in impacted teeth. Impacted wisdom teeth are very common. They are often painless and do not cause problems. However, some professionals believe an impacted tooth pushes on the next tooth, which pushes the next tooth. Eventually, this can cause a misaligned bite. A partially emerged tooth can trap food, plaque, and other debris in the soft tissue around it, which can lead to inflammation and tenderness of the gums and unpleasant mouth odor. This is called pericoronitis. The retained debris may also lead to the decay on the wisdom tooth or the neighboring tooth, or even bone loss.",There may be no symptoms of a fully impacted tooth. Symptoms of a partially impacted tooth may include: Bad breath Difficulty opening the mouth (occasionally) Pain or tenderness of the gums or jaw bone Prolonged headache or jaw ache Redness and swelling of the gums around the impacted tooth Swollen lymph nodes of the neck (occasionally) Unpleasant taste when biting down on or near the area Visible gap where a tooth did not emerge,,Tooth - unemerged; Unemerged tooth; Dental impaction; Unerupted tooth

Impetigo,Impetigo is a common skin infection.,"Impetigo is caused by streptococcus (strep) or staphylococcus (staph) bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staph aureus ( MRSA ) is an increasing cause. Skin typically has many types of bacteria on it. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there. This causes inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur from injury or trauma to the skin or from insect, animal, or human bites. Impetigo may also occur on the skin, where there is no visible break. Impetigo is most common in children who live in unhealthy conditions. In adults, it may occur following another skin problem. It may also develop after a cold or other virus. Impetigo can spread to others. You can catch the infection from someone who has it if the fluid that oozes from their skin blisters touches an open area on your skin.","Symptoms of impetigo are: One or many blisters that are filled with pus and easy to pop. In infants, the skin is reddish or raw-looking where a blister has broken. Blisters that itch are filled with yellow or honey-colored fluid and ooze and crust over.

Infant - newborn development,Infant development is most often divided into the following areas:,,,,
Infant botulism,Infant botulism is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. It grows inside a baby's gastrointestinal tract.,"Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming organism that is common in nature. The spores may be found in soil and certain foods (such as honey and some corn syrups). Infant botulism occurs mostly in young infants between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. It may occur as early as 6 days and as late as 1 year. Risk factors include swallowing honey as a baby, being around contaminated soil, and having less than one stool per day for a period greater than 2 months.","Symptoms may include: Breathing that stops or slows Constipation Eyelids that sag or partially close ""Floppy"" body Absence of gagging Loss of head control Paralysis that spreads downward Poor feeding and weak suckling Respiratory failure Extreme tiredness (lethargy) Weak cry",,

Infant of a substance-using mother,"Maternal substance use may consist of any combination of drug, chemical, alcohol, and tobacco use during the pregnancy.",,,,
Infant of diabetic mother,A fetus (baby) of a mother with diabetes may be exposed to high blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the pregnancy.,"There are two forms of diabetes during pregnancy: Gestational diabetes -- high blood sugar (diabetes) that starts or is first detected during pregnancy Pre-existing or pre-gestational diabetes -- already having diabetes before becoming pregnant If diabetes is not well controlled during pregnancy, the baby is exposed to high blood sugar levels. This can affect the baby and mother during pregnancy, at the time of birth, and after birth. Infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are often larger than other babies, especially if diabetes is not well-controlled. This may make vaginal birth harder and may increase the risk for nerve injuries and other trauma during birth. Also, cesarean births are more likely. An IDM is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth, and during the first few days of life. This is because the baby has been used to getting more sugar than needed from the mother. They have a higher insulin level than needed after birth. Insulin lowers the blood sugar. It can take days for babies' insulin levels to adjust after birth. IDMs are more likely to have: Breathing difficulty due to less mature lungs High red blood cell count (polycythemia) High bilirubin level (newborn jaundice) Thickening of the heart muscle between the large chambers (ventricles) If diabetes is not well-controlled, chances of miscarriage or stillbirth are higher. An IDM has a higher risk of birth defects if the mother has pre-existing diabetes that is not well controlled from the very beginning.","The infant is often larger than usual for babies born after the same length of time in the mother's womb (large for gestational age). In some cases, especially if mothers have more longstanding illness, the baby may be smaller (small for gestational age). Other symptoms may include: Blue skin color, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing (signs of immature lungs or heart failure) Poor sucking, lethargy, weak cry Seizures (sign of severe low blood sugar) Poor feeding Puffy face Tremors or shaking shortly after birth Jaundice (yellow skin color)",,IDM; Gestational diabetes - IDM; Neonatal care - diabetic mother

Infertility,Infertility means you cannot get pregnant (conceive).,"Many medical conditions can cause infertility. It may be due to conditions in the woman, man, or both. FEMALE INFERTILITY Female infertility may occur when: A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus). The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus. The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb. The ovaries have problems producing healthy eggs. Female infertility may be caused by: Autoimmune disorders , such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract Cancer or tumor Clotting disorders Diabetes Drinking too much alcohol Exercising too much Eating disorders or poor nutrition Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs Failure to ovulate Being overweight or underweight Older age Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Pelvic infection resulting in scarring or swelling of fallopian tubes (hydrosalpinx) or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis Smoking Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis) Thyroid disease MALE INFERTILITY Male infertility may be due to: Decreased number of sperm Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released Defects in the sperm Male infertility can be caused by: Birth defects Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine Benign pituitary tumor (causing high blood level of prolactin) Diabetes (uncontrolled) Hypogonadism causing low levels of the male hormone testosterone Impotence Infection Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin Obesity Older age Retrograde ejaculation Scarring from sexually transmitted infections (STIs), injury, or surgery Smoking Toxins in the environment Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal History of testicular infection from mumps Healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly will have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month. A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant begins to decrease around age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman. Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 years of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This may help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option. However, women who know they will need to delay childbearing may consider it.",,,Inability to conceive; Unable to get pregnant

Ingrown toenail,An ingrown toenail occurs when the edge of the nail grows into the skin of the toe.,"An ingrown toenail can result from a number of things. Poorly fitting shoes and toenails that are not properly trimmed are the most common causes. The skin along the edge of a toenail may become red and infected. The great toe is affected most often, but any toenail can become ingrown. An ingrown toenail may occur when extra pressure is placed on your toe. This pressure is caused by shoes that are too tight or fit poorly. If you walk often or play sports, a shoe that is even a little tight can cause this problem. Deformities of the foot or toes can also place extra pressure on the toe. Nails that are not trimmed properly can also cause ingrown toenails: Toenails that are trimmed too short, or if the edges are rounded rather than cut straight across may cause the nail to curl and grow into the skin. Poor eyesight, inability to reach the toes easily, or having thick nails can make it hard to properly trim nails. Picking or tearing at the corners of the nails can also cause an ingrown toenail. Some people are born with nails that are curved and grow into the skin. Others have toenails that are too large for their toes. Stubbing your toe or other injuries can also lead to an ingrown toenail.","There may be pain, redness, and swelling around the nail.",,Onychocryptosis; Unguis incarnates; Surgical nail avulsion; Matrix excision; Ingrown toenail removal

Insulinoma,An insulinoma is a tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin.,"The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. The pancreas makes several enzymes and hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping sugar move into cells. Most of the time when your blood sugar level decreases, the pancreas stops making insulin to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the normal range. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, and can make your blood sugar level too low (hypoglycemia). A high blood insulin level causes a low blood sugar level ( hypoglycemia ). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death. Insulinomas are very rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors. But there can also be several small tumors. Most insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with certain genetic disorders, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type I , are at higher risk for insulinomas.","Symptoms are most common when you are fasting or skip or delay a meal.

Interstitial lung disease,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of lung disorders in which the lung tissues become inflamed and then damaged.,"The lungs contain tiny air sacs (alveoli), which is where oxygen is absorbed. These air sacs expand with each breath. The tissue around these air sacs is called the interstitium. In people with interstitial lung disease, this tissue becomes inflamed, stiff, or scarred, and the air sacs are not able to expand as much. As a result, not as much oxygen can get to the body. ILD can occur without a known cause. This is called idiopathic ILD. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common disease of this type. There are also dozens of known causes of ILD, including: Autoimmune diseases (in which the immune system attacks the body) such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoidosis , and scleroderma . Lung inflammation due to breathing in a foreign substance such as certain types of dust, fungus, or mold ( hypersensitivity pneumonitis ). Medicines (such as nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, bleomycin, amiodarone, methotrexate, gold, infliximab, etanercept, and other chemotherapy medicines). Radiation treatment to the chest. Working with or around asbestos, coal dust, cotton dust, and silica dust (called occupational lung disease). Infection and partial recovery from diseases like COVID-19. Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing some forms of ILD and may cause the disease to be more severe.","Shortness of breath is a main symptom of ILD. You may breathe faster or need to take deep breaths: At first, shortness of breath may not be severe and is only noticed with exercise, climbing stairs, and other activities. Over time, it can occur with less strenuous activity such as bathing or dressing, and as the disease worsens, even with eating or talking. Most people with this condition also have a dry cough.

Intestinal pseudo-obstruction,Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition in which there are symptoms of blockage of the intestine (bowels) without any physical blockage.,"In intestinal pseudo-obstruction, the intestine does not contract and push food, stool, and air through the digestive tract. The chronic disorder most often affects the small intestine, but can also occur in the large intestine (colon). The acute disorder usually affects the large intestine. The condition may start suddenly or be a chronic or long-term problem. Sudden onset is called acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction and usually affects the small intestine and often other parts of the digestive tract. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction usually affects the large intestine (colon.) It is most common in children and older people. The cause of the problem is often unknown. However, problems with the bowel's muscles or nerves may be a cause. Risk factors include: Cerebral palsy or other brain or nervous system disorders. Chronic kidney, lung, or heart disease. Staying in bed for long periods of time (bedridden). Taking medicines that slow intestinal movements.

Intrauterine growth restriction,Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to the poor growth of a baby while in the mother's womb during pregnancy.,"Many different things can lead to IUGR. An unborn baby may not get enough oxygen and nutrition from the placenta during pregnancy because of: Mother living at high altitude Multiple pregnancy, such as twins or triplets Placenta problems Preeclampsia or eclampsia Problems at birth (congenital abnormalities) or chromosome problems are often associated with below-normal weight. Infections during pregnancy can also affect the weight of the developing baby. These include: Cytomegalovirus Rubella Syphilis Toxoplasmosis Risk factors in the mother that may contribute to IUGR include: Alcohol abuse Smoking Drug addiction Clotting disorders High blood pressure or heart disease Diabetes Kidney disease Poor nutrition Thyroid disease Anemia Uterine malformations Multiple gestation Other chronic disease If the mother is small, it may be normal for her baby to be small, and this is not due to IUGR. Depending on the cause of IUGR, the developing baby may be small all over. Or, the baby's head may be normal size while the rest of the body is small.",A pregnant woman may feel that her baby is not as big as it should be.

Intraventricular hemorrhage of the newborn,Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of the newborn is bleeding into the fluid-filled areas (ventricles) inside the brain. The condition occurs most often in babies that are born early (premature).,"Infants born more than 10 weeks early are at highest risk for this type of bleeding. The smaller and more premature an infant is, the higher the risk for IVH. This is because blood vessels in the brain of premature infants are not yet fully developed. They are very fragile as a result. The blood vessels grow stronger in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. IVH is more common in premature babies with: Respiratory distress syndrome Unstable blood pressure Other medical conditions at birth The problem may also occur in otherwise healthy babies who were born early. Rarely, IVH may develop in full-term babies. IVH is rarely present at birth. It occurs most often in the first several days of life. The condition is rare after the first month of age, even if the baby was born early. There are four types of IVH. These are called ""grades"" and are based on the degree of bleeding. Grades 1 and 2 involve a smaller amount of bleeding. Most of the time, there are no long-term problems as a result of the bleeding. Grade 1 is also referred to as germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH). Grades 3 and 4 involve more severe bleeding. The blood presses on (grade 3) or directly involves (grade 4) brain tissue. Grade 4 is also called an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Blood clots can form and block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. This can lead to increased fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus).",There may be no symptoms. The most common symptoms seen in premature infants include: Breathing pauses (apnea) Changes in blood pressure and heart rate Decreased muscle tone Decreased reflexes Excessive sleep Lethargy Weak suck Seizures and other abnormal movements,,IVH - newborn; GMH-IVH

Intussusception – children,Intussusception is the sliding of one part of the intestine into another.,"Intussusception is caused by part of the intestine being pulled inward into itself. The pressure created by the walls of the intestine pressing together causes: Decreased blood flow Irritation Swelling Intussusception can block the passage of food through the intestine. If the blood supply is cut off, the segment of intestine pulled inside can die. Heavy bleeding may also occur. If a hole develops, infection, shock , and dehydration can take place very rapidly. The cause of intussusception is not known. Conditions that may lead to the problem include: Viral infection Enlarged lymph node in the intestine Polyp or tumor in the bowel Intussusception can affect both children and adults. It is more common in boys. It usually affects children ages 5 months to 3 years.","The first sign of intussusception is very often sudden, loud crying caused by abdominal pain . The pain is colicky and not continuous (intermittent), but it comes back often. The pain will get stronger and last longer each time it returns.

Iron deficiency anemia,Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types and causes of anemia.,"Red blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells. Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because: You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace Your body does not absorb iron well Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain iron Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding) Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are: Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colon Esophageal varices , often from cirrhosis The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or medicines that may thin the blood for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding Peptic ulcer disease Your body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to: Celiac disease Crohn disease Gastric bypass surgery Taking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline You may not get enough iron in your diet if: You are a strict vegetarian You do not eat enough foods that contain iron","You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild.

Irritable bowel syndrome,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to pain in abdomen and changes in bowel movements.,"The reasons why IBS develops are not clear. It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress. The intestine is connected to the brain by hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. IBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men. It is less likely to begin in people above 50 years of age. About 10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist).","IBS symptoms vary from person to person, and range from mild to severe. Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more. The main symptoms include: Abdominal pain and cramps Gas Fullness Bloating Change in bowel habits. You can have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C). Pain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements. People with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other. If you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools. You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control. If you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass. The symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time. You may also lose your appetite if you have IBS.

Jaundice,"Jaundice is a yellow color of the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes. The yellow coloring comes from bilirubin, a byproduct of old red blood cells. Jaundice can be a symptom of several health problems.","A small number of red blood cells in your body die each day, and are replaced by new ones. The liver removes the old blood cells. This creates bilirubin. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed by the body through the stool. Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body. Jaundice can occur if: Too many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver. The liver is overloaded or damaged. The bilirubin from the liver is unable to move normally into the digestive tract. Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Things that can cause jaundice include: Infections, most commonly viral Use of certain drugs Cancer of the liver, bile ducts or pancreas Blood disorders, gallstones, birth defects and a number of other medical conditions","Jaundice may appear suddenly or develop slowly over time.

Jaundice and breastfeeding,Jaundice is a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. There are two common problems that may occur in newborns receiving breast milk.,"Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced as the body recycles old red blood cells. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool. It can be normal for newborn babies to be a little yellow between days 1 and 5 of life. The color most often peaks around day 3 or 4. Breast milk jaundice is seen after the first week of life. It is likely caused by: Factors in a mother's milk that help a baby absorb bilirubin from the intestine Factors that keep certain proteins in the baby's liver from breaking down bilirubin Sometimes, jaundice occurs when your baby does not get enough breast milk, instead of from the breast milk itself. This kind of jaundice is different because it starts in the first few days of life. It is called ""breastfeeding failure jaundice,"" ""breast-non-feeding jaundice,"" or even ""starvation jaundice."" Babies who are born early (before 37 or 38 weeks) are not always able to feed well. Breastfeeding failure or breast-non-feeding jaundice may also occur when feedings are scheduled by the clock (such as, every 3 hours for 10 minutes) or when babies who show signs of hunger are given pacifiers.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a term used to describe a group of disorders in children that includes arthritis. They are long-term (chronic) diseases that cause joint pain and swelling. The names describing this group of conditions has changed over the past several decades as more is learned about the condition.,"The cause of JIA is not known. It is thought to be an autoimmune illness . This means the body attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. JIA most often develops before age 16. Symptoms may start as early as 6 months old. The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) has proposed the following way of grouping this type of childhood arthritis: Systemic-onset JIA. Involves joint swelling or pain, fevers, and rash. It is the least common type but it can be the most severe. It appears to be different than the other types of JIA and is similar to Adult Onset Stills Disease. Polyarthritis. Involves many joints. This form of JIA may turn into rheumatoid arthritis. It may involve 5 or more large and small joints of the legs and arms, as well as the jaw and neck. Rheumatoid factor may be present. Oligoarthritis (persistent and extended). Involves 1 to 4 joints, most often the wrists, or knees. It also affects the eyes. Enthesitis-related arthritis. Resembles spondyloarthritis in adults and often involves the sacroiliac joint. Psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosed in children who have arthritis and psoriasis or nail disease, or have a close family member with psoriasis.","Symptoms of JIA may include: Swollen, red, or warm joint Limping or problems using a limb Sudden high fever, which may come back Rash (on trunk and extremities) that comes and goes with fever Stiffness, pain, and limited movement of a joint Low back pain that does not go away Bodywide symptoms such as pale skin, swollen lymph gland, and a sick appearance JIA can also cause eye problems called uveitis , iridocyclitis, or iritis. There may be no eye symptoms. When eye symptoms occur, they can include: Red eyes Eye pain , which may get worse when looking at light ( photophobia ) Vision changes",,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
Kaposi sarcoma,Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancerous tumor of the connective tissue.,"KS is the result of infection with a gamma herpesvirus known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). It is in the same family as the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis . KSHV is transmitted mainly through saliva. It can also be spread through sexual contact, blood transfusion, or transplants. After it enters the body, the virus can infect different kinds of cells, especially cells that line blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Like all herpesviruses, KSHV remains in your body for the rest of your life. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms. There are four types of KS based on the groups of people who are infected: Classic KS: Mainly affects older men of Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent. The disease usually develops slowly. Epidemic (AIDS-related) KS: Occurs most often in people who have HIV infection and have developed AIDS. Endemic (African) KS: Mainly affects people of all ages in Africa. Immunosuppression-associated, or transplantation-associated, KS: Occurs in people who have had an organ transplant and take medicines that suppress their immune system.",The tumors (lesions) most often appear as bluish-red or purple bumps on the skin. They are reddish-purple because they are rich in blood vessels. The lesions may first appear on any part of the body. They also can appear inside the body. Lesions inside the body may bleed. Lesions in the lungs can cause bloody sputum or shortness of breath .,,Kaposi's sarcoma; HIV - Kaposi; AIDS - Kaposi; Kaposi's sarcoma

Keratoconus,Keratoconus is an eye disease that affects the structure of the cornea. The cornea is the clear tissue that covers the front of the eye.,The cause is unknown. It is likely that the tendency to develop keratoconus is present from birth. The condition may be due to a defect in collagen. This is the tissue that provides the shape and strength to the cornea. Allergy and eye rubbing may speed up the damage. There is a link between keratoconus and Down syndrome .,"The earliest symptom is a slight blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses. (Vision can most often be corrected to 20/20 with rigid, gas-permeable contact lenses.) Over time, you may see halos, have glare, or other night vision problems. Most people who develop keratoconus have a history of being nearsighted . The nearsightedness tends to become worse over time. As the problem gets worse, astigmatism develops and may worsen over time. Keratoconus is often discovered during the teenage years. It may also develop in older people.",,Vision changes - keratoconus

Kidney stones,A kidney stone is a solid mass made up of tiny crystals. One or more stones can be in the kidney or ureter at the same time.,"Kidney stones are common. Some types run in families. They may occur at any age, including in premature infants. There are different types of kidney stones. The cause depends on the type of stone. Stones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances that form crystals. These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months. Calcium stones are most common. They are most likely to occur in men between ages 20 to 30. Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone. Oxalate is the most common of these substances. Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach. It is also found in vitamin C supplements. Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones. Calcium stones can also form by combining with phosphate or carbonate. Other types of stones include: Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria . This disorder runs in families. It affects both men and women. Struvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated urinary tract infections . These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or after receiving chemotherapy for some types of cancer. Other substances, such as certain medicines, also can form stones. The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than 1 liter (32 ounces) of urine a day.","You may not have symptoms until the stone moves down the tube (ureters) through which urine empties into your bladder. When this happens, the stone can block the flow of urine out of the kidneys, causing pain. The main symptom is severe pain that starts and stops suddenly: Pain may be felt in the belly area or side of the back. Pain may move to the groin area ( groin pain ), testicles ( testicle pain ) in men, and labia (vaginal pain) in women.

Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome, also called 47,XXY, is a genetic condition that occurs in males when they have an extra X chromosome. This can cause problems with development and fertility. Some men have no symptoms and never know they have it.","Most people have 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. The 2 sex chromosomes (X and Y) determine the genetic sex of a child. The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome. Normally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father is a genetic female and has 2 X chromosomes. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male and has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome . Klinefelter syndrome results when a male child is born with at least 1 extra X chromosome. They have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This is written as 47, XXY. Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a random event. There is no exact cause, and the condition is not inherited. Klinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 500 to 1,000 male infants. Women who get pregnant after age 35 are slightly more likely to have a male child with this syndrome than younger women.","Symptoms vary widely, with some males having few or only mild signs. Some may never know they have the condition or only discover it as adults when they have fertility problems. Others experience delayed growth and development in childhood. Symptoms may include any of the following: Urethra on the underside of the penis ( hypospadias ) Testicles that have not moved into the scrotum Being slow to sit up, walk, crawl, and speak Delayed puberty Small, firm testicles Language learning disorders, including dyslexia, which affects reading Abnormal body proportions (long legs, short trunk, shoulder equal to hip size) Enlarged breasts ( gynecomastia ) Less than normal amount of pubic, armpit, and facial hair Tall height Small penis size Infertility Sexual problems Social, emotional, or behavioral problems Mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety",,"47 XXY syndrome; XXY syndrome; XXY trisomy; 47,XXY/46,XY; 47,XXY/46,XY mosaicism; Poly-X Klinefelter syndrome"

Knee pain,"Knee pain is a common symptom in people of all ages. It may start suddenly, often after an injury or exercise. Knee pain also may begin as a mild discomfort, then slowly get worse.","Knee pain can have different causes. Being overweight puts you at greater risk for knee problems. Overusing your knee can trigger knee problems that cause pain. If you have a history of arthritis, it could also cause knee pain. Here are some common causes of knee pain: MEDICAL CONDITIONS Arthritis -- Including rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis , lupus , and gout Baker cyst -- A fluid-filled swelling behind the knee that may occur with swelling (inflammation) from other causes, such as arthritis Cancers that either spread to your bones or begin in the bones Osgood-Schlatter disease Infection in the bones around the knee Infection in the knee joint INJURIES AND OVERUSE Bursitis -- Inflammation from repeated pressure on the knee, such as kneeling for a long time, overuse, or injury Tendinitis -- Inflammation of the tendon with change in activities, can be related to overuse or deconditioned tissue Dislocation of the kneecap Fracture of the kneecap or other bones Iliotibial band syndrome -- Injury to the thick band that runs from your hip to the outside of your knee Patellofemoral syndrome -- Pain in the front of your knee around the kneecap Torn ligament. -- An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, or medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury may cause bleeding into your knee, swelling, or an unstable knee Torn cartilage (a meniscus tear ) -- Pain felt on the inside or outside of the knee joint Strain or sprain -- Minor injuries to the ligaments caused by sudden or unnatural twisting",,"Simple causes of knee pain often clear up on their own while you take steps to manage your symptoms. If knee pain is caused by an accident or injury, you should contact your health care provider. If your knee pain has just started and is not severe, you can: Rest and avoid activities that cause pain. Avoid putting weight on your knee. Apply ice. First, apply it every hour for up to 15 minutes. After the first day, apply it at least 4 times per day. Cover your knee with a towel before applying ice. Do not fall asleep while using ice. You can leave it on too long and get frostbite. Keep your knee raised as much as possible to bring down any swelling. Wear an elastic bandage or elastic sleeve, which you can buy at most pharmacies. This may reduce swelling and provide support. Take ibuprofen (Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) for pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help relieve pain, but not swelling. Talk to your provider before taking these medicines if you have medical problems, or if you have taken them for more than a day or two. Sleep with a pillow underneath or between your knees. Follow these general tips to help relieve and prevent knee pain: Always warm up before exercising and cool down after exercising. Stretch the muscles in the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and in the back of your thigh (hamstrings). Avoid running down hills -- walk down instead. Bicycle, or better yet, swim instead of run. Reduce the amount of exercise you do. Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track, instead of on cement or pavement. Lose weight if you are overweight. Every pound (0.5 kilogram) that you are overweight puts about 5 extra pounds (2.25 kilograms) of pressure on your kneecap when you go up and down stairs. The amount of extra pressure is even greater when you jump. Ask your provider for help losing weight. If you have flat feet, try special shoe inserts and arch supports (orthotics). Make sure your running shoes are well made, fit well, and have good cushioning. Further steps for you to take may depend on the cause of your knee pain.",Pain - knee
Kneecap dislocation,Kneecap dislocation occurs when the round-shaped bone covering the knee (patella) moves or slides out of place. The dislocation often occurs toward the outside of the leg.,"Kneecap dislocation often occurs after a sudden change in direction when your leg is planted. This puts your kneecap under stress. This can occur when playing certain sports, such as basketball. Dislocation may also occur as result of direct trauma. When the kneecap is dislocated, it can slip sideways to the outside of the knee.","Symptoms of kneecap dislocation include: Knee appears to be deformed Knee is bent and cannot be straightened out Kneecap (patella) dislocates to the outside of the knee Knee pain and tenderness Knee swelling ""Sloppy"" kneecap -- you can move the kneecap too much from right to left (hypermobile patella) The first few times this occurs, you will feel pain and may be unable to walk. If you continue to have dislocations, your knee may not hurt as much and you may not be as disabled. This is not a reason to avoid treatment. Kneecap dislocation damages your knee joint. It can lead to cartilage injuries and increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis at a younger age. Repeat dislocations will make the condition worse and harder to treat.",,Dislocation - kneecap; Patellar dislocation or instability
Knock knees,"Knock knees are condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward.","Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart. By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position). Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as: Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed) Osteomyelitis (bone infection) Overweight or obesity Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D)",,,Genu valgum
Krabbe disease,Krabbe disease is a rare genetic disorder of the nervous system. It is a type of brain disease called leukodystrophy.,"A defect in the GALC gene causes Krabbe disease. People with this gene defect do not make enough of a substance ( enzyme ) called galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase). The body needs this enzyme to make myelin. Myelin surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Without this enzyme, myelin breaks down, brain cells die, and nerves in the brain and other body areas do not work properly. Krabbe disease can develop at various ages: Early-onset Krabbe disease appears in the first months of life. Most children with this form of the disease die before they reach age 2. Late-onset Krabbe disease begins in late childhood or early adolescence. Krabbe disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. It is an autosomal recessive disorder . This condition is very rare. It is most common among people of Scandinavian descent.","Symptoms of early-onset Krabbe disease are: Changing muscle tone from floppy to rigid Hearing loss that leads to deafness Failure to thrive Feeding difficulties Irritability and sensitivity to loud sounds Severe seizures (may begin at a very early age) Unexplained fevers Vision loss that leads to blindness Vomiting With late onset Krabbe disease, vision problems may appear first, followed by walking difficulties and rigid muscles. Symptoms vary from person to person. Other symptoms may also occur.",,Globoid cell leukodystrophy; Galactosylcerebrosidase deficiency; Galactosylceramidase deficiency
Kuru,Kuru is a disease of the nervous system.,"Kuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue. Kuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period. The incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after being exposed to the agent that causes disease. Kuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease. The main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.","Symptoms of kuru include: Arm and leg pain Coordination problems that become severe Difficulty walking Headache Swallowing difficulty Tremors and muscle jerks Difficulty swallowing and being unable to feed oneself can lead to malnutrition or starvation. The average incubation period is 10 to 13 years, but incubation period of 50 years or even longer have also been reported.",,Prion disease - kuru
Kwashiorkor,Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition that occurs when there is not enough protein in the diet.,"Kwashiorkor is most common in areas where there is: Famine Limited food supply Low levels of education (when people do not understand how to eat a proper diet) This disease is more common in very poor countries. It may occur during: Drought or other natural disaster Political unrest These events often lead to a lack of food, causing malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is rare in children in the United States. There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as half of older age people living in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet. When kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of child abuse and severe neglect.",Symptoms include: Changes in skin pigment Decreased muscle mass Diarrhea Failure to gain weight and grow Fatigue Hair changes (change in color or texture) Increased and more severe infections due to damaged immune system Irritability Large belly that sticks out (protrudes) Lethargy or apathy Loss of muscle mass Rash (dermatitis) Shock (late stage) Swelling ( edema ),,Protein malnutrition; Protein-calorie malnutrition; Malignant malnutrition

Lacrimal gland tumor,A lacrimal gland tumor is a tumor in one of the glands that produces tears. The lacrimal gland is located under the outer part of each eyebrow. Lacrimal gland tumors can be harmless (benign) or cancerous (malignant). About half of lacrimal gland tumors are benign. Some masses in the lacrimal gland are not really tumors but may be due to inflammation or overgrowth of lymphoid tissue.,,Symptoms may include: Double vision Fullness in one eyelid or the side of the face Pain,,

Lactic acidosis,Lactic acidosis refers to lactic acid build up in the bloodstream. Lactic acid is produced when oxygen levels become low in cells within the areas of the body where metabolism takes place or in response to sympathetic overactivity related to epinephrine-type substances or exercise.,"The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness in which blood pressure is low and too little oxygen is reaching the body's tissues. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition, including: AIDS Alcoholism Cancer Cirrhosis Cyanide poisoning Kidney failure Respiratory failure Sepsis (severe infection) Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis: Beta adrenergic agonist inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD (albuterol and salmeterol) Epinephrine Linezolid Metformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed) Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV infection Propofol",Symptoms may include: Nausea Vomiting Weakness,,
Lactose intolerance,Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. An enzyme called lactase is needed by the body to digest lactose.,"Babies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk. Babies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance. Children who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old. Lactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20. In white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5. This is the age when our bodies may stop making lactase. In African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2. The condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage. It is less common in people of northern or western European background, but still may occur. An illness that involves or injures your small intestine may cause less of the lactase enzyme to be made. Treatment of these illnesses may improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These may include: Surgery of the small intestine Infections in the small intestine (this is most often seen in children) Diseases that damage the small intestines, such as celiac disease or Crohn disease Any illness that causes diarrhea Babies may be born with a genetic variant, which may make them unable to make any of the lactase enzyme.",Symptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after having milk products. Symptoms may be worse when you consume large amounts. Symptoms include: Abdominal bloating Abdominal cramps Diarrhea Gas ( flatulence ) Nausea,,Lactase deficiency; Milk intolerance; Disaccharidase deficiency; Dairy product intolerance; Diarrhea - lactose intolerance; Bloating - lactose intolerance
Lactose tolerance tests,"Lactose tolerance tests measure the ability of your intestines to break down a type of sugar called lactose. This sugar is found in milk and other dairy products. If your body cannot break down this sugar, you are said to have lactose intolerance. This can cause gassiness, abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea.",,,,Hydrogen breath test for lactose tolerance
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare disorder in which faulty communication between nerves and muscles leads to muscle weakness.,"LEMS is an autoimmune disorder . This means your immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and tissues in the body. With LEMS, antibodies produced by the immune system attack nerve cells. This makes nerves cells unable to release enough of a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical transmits impulses between nerves and muscles. The result is muscle weakness. LEMS may occur with cancers such as small cell lung cancer or autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo , which leads to a loss of skin pigment. LEMS affects men more often than women. The most common age of occurrence is around age 60 years. LEMS is rare in children.","Weakness or loss of movement that can be more or less severe, including: Difficulty climbing stairs, walking, or lifting things Muscle pain Drooping of the head The need to use the hands to get up from a sitting or lying position Problems talking Problems chewing or swallowing, which may include gagging or choking Vision changes, such as blurry vision , double vision, and problem keeping a steady gaze Weakness is generally mild in LEMS. Leg muscles are mostly affected. Weakness may improve after exercise, but continuous exertion causes fatigue in some cases.

Lamellar ichthyosis,Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is a rare skin condition. It appears at birth and continues throughout life.,LI is an autosomal recessive disease . This means that the mother and father must both pass one abnormal copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease.,"Many babies with LI are born with a clear, shiny, waxy layer of skin called a collodion membrane. For this reason, these babies are known as collodion babies. The membrane sheds within the first 2 weeks of life. The skin underneath the membrane is red and scaly resembling the surface of a fish. With LI, the outer layer of skin called the epidermis cannot protect the body like the healthy epidermis can. As a result, a baby with LI may have the following health problems: Difficulty in feeding Loss of fluid ( dehydration ) Loss of balance of minerals in the body ( electrolyte imbalance) Breathing problems Body temperature that is not stable Skin or body-wide infections Older children and adults with LI may have these symptoms: Giant scales that cover most of the body Decreased ability to sweat, causing sensitivity to heat Hair loss Abnormal finger and toenails Skin of the palms and soles is thickened",,LI; Collodion baby - lamellar ichthyosis; Ichthyosis congenital; Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis - lamellar ichthyosis type

Language disorders in children,Language disorders in children are problems with the development of language skills.,"Most infants and children develop language naturally starting at birth. To develop language, a child must be able to hear, see, understand, and remember. Children must also be physically able to form speech. Up to 1 of every 14 children has symptoms of a language disorder. When the cause is unknown, it is called a developmental language disorder. Problems with receptive language skills usually begin before age 4. Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury. These conditions are sometimes misdiagnosed as developmental disorders. Language disorders may occur in children with: Other developmental problems Autism spectrum disorder Hearing loss Learning disabilities Damage to the central nervous system, which is called aphasia Language disorders are rarely caused by a lack of intelligence. Language disorders are not the same as delayed language. With delayed language, the child develops speech and language in the same way as other children, but later. In language disorders, speech and language do not develop normally. The child may have some language skills, but not others. Or, the way in which these skills develop will be different than usual.","Children with language disorders may have one, two, or many of the symptoms listed below. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Children with a receptive language disorder have problems understanding language. They may have: A hard time understanding what other people have said Problems following directions that are spoken to them Problems organizing their thoughts Children with an expressive language disorder have problems using language to express what they are thinking or need. These children may: Have a hard time putting words together into sentences Use short and simple sentences and the word order may be off Have difficulty finding the right words when talking, and often use placeholder words such as ""um"" Have a vocabulary that is below the level of other children the same age Leave words out of sentences when talking Use certain phrases over and over again, and repeat (echo) parts or all of questions Use tenses (past, present, future) improperly Children with language problems may have difficulty in social settings.

Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms. However, it is more common for lead poisoning to occur slowly over time. This results from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher. Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable. Possible complications include: Behavior or attention problems Failure at school Hearing problems Kidney damage Reduced IQ Slowed body growth The symptoms of lead poisoning may include: Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the first sign of a high, toxic dose of lead) Aggressive behavior Anemia (low red blood cell count) Constipation Difficulty getting pregnant Difficulty sleeping Headaches Hearing loss Irritability Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children) Low appetite and energy Reduced sensations Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, internal bleeding, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures , or coma.","You can reduce exposure to lead with the following steps: If you suspect you may have lead paint in your house, get advice on safe removal from the National Lead Information Center -- www.epa.gov/lead at (800) 424-5323. Keep your home as dust-free as possible. Have everyone wash their hands before eating. Throw out old painted toys if you do not know whether the paint contains lead. Let tap water run for a minute before drinking or cooking with it. If your water has tested high in lead, consider installing an effective filtering device or switch to bottled water for drinking and cooking. Avoid canned goods from foreign countries until the ban on lead soldered cans goes into effect.

Leprosy,"Leprosy is a disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. This disease causes skin sores, nerve damage, and muscle weakness that gets worse over time.","Although leprosy is due to an infection, it does not spread easily. It also takes a long time before symptoms appear, which makes it hard to know where or when someone caught the disease. Children are more likely than adults to get the disease. Most people who come in contact with the bacteria don't develop the disease. This is because their immune system is able to fight off the bacteria. Experts believe that the bacteria spread when a person breathes in tiny airborne droplets released when someone with leprosy coughs or sneezes. The bacteria may also be passed through contact with the nasal fluids of a person with leprosy. Leprosy has two common forms: tuberculoid and lepromatous. Both forms produce sores on the skin. However, the lepromatous form is more severe. It causes large lumps and bumps ( nodules ). Leprosy is common in many countries worldwide including India, Brazil and Indonesia. It is also found in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. About 170 to 200 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States. Most new cases in the United States were in: Florida California Hawaii New York Oregon Texas Drug-resistant Mycobacterium leprae and an increased numbers of cases worldwide have led to global concern for this disease.","Symptoms include: Skin lesions that are lighter than your normal skin color Lesions that have decreased sensation to touch, heat, or pain Lesions that do not heal after several weeks to months Muscle weakness Numbness or lack of feeling in the hands, arms, feet, and legs",,Hansen disease

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome,Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a disorder that is passed down through families (inherited). It affects how the body builds and breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines are a normal part of human tissue that help make up the body's genetic blueprint. They are also found in many different foods.,"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is passed down as an X-linked, or sex-linked trait . It occurs mostly in boys. People with this syndrome are missing or severely lacking an enzyme called hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The body needs this substance to recycle purines. Without it, abnormally high levels of uric acid build up in the body.","Too much uric acid can cause gout-like swelling in some of the joints. In some cases, kidney and bladder stones develop.

Low blood potassium,Low blood potassium level is a condition in which the amount of potassium in the blood is lower than normal. The medical name of this condition is hypokalemia.,"Potassium is an electrolyte (mineral). It is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. The kidneys remove excess potassium through the urinary system to keep a proper balance of the mineral in the body. Common causes of low blood potassium include: Medicines, such as diuretics (water pills), certain antibiotics (amphotericin B, chloroquine at toxic levels) Diarrhea or vomiting Eating disorders (such as bulimia ) Hyperaldosteronism Laxative overuse, which can cause diarrhea Chronic kidney disease Low magnesium level Sweating Genetic disorders, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis , Bartter syndrome","A small drop in the blood potassium level often does not cause symptoms or causes mild to moderate symptoms, which may include: Constipation Feeling of skipped heart beats or palpitations Fatigue Muscle damage Muscle weakness or spasms Tingling or numbness A large drop in the blood potassium level may lead to abnormal heart rhythms , especially in people with heart disease. This can cause you to feel lightheaded or faint. A very low blood potassium level can even cause your heart to stop.",,Potassium - low; Low blood potassium; Hypokalemia
Low blood pressure,"Low blood pressure occurs when blood pressure is much lower than normal. This means the heart, brain, and other parts of the body may not get enough blood. Normal blood pressure is mostly between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg.","Blood pressure varies from one person to another. A drop of as little as 20 mmHg can cause problems for some people. There are different types and causes of low blood pressure. Severe hypotension (shock) can be caused by sudden loss of blood ( shock ), severe infection, heart attack , or severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ). Orthostatic hypotension means your blood pressure drops when you shift from lying down to standing. This type of low blood pressure usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes. If this type of low blood pressure occurs after eating, it is called postprandial orthostatic hypotension. This type most often affects older adults, those with high blood pressure, and people with Parkinson disease . Neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) most often affects young adults and children. It can occur when a person has been standing for a long time. Children usually outgrow this type of hypotension. Certain medicines and substances can lead to low blood pressure, including: Alcohol Anti-anxiety medicines Certain antidepressants Diuretics Heart medicines, including those used to treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease Medicines used for surgery Painkillers Other causes of low blood pressure include: Nerve damage from diabetes or other disorders Changes in heart rhythm ( arrhythmias ) Not drinking enough fluids ( dehydration ) Heart failure",Symptoms of low blood pressure may include: Blurry vision Confusion Dizziness Fainting (syncope) Lightheadedness Nausea or vomiting Sleepiness Weakness,,Hypotension; Blood pressure - low; Postprandial hypotension; Orthostatic hypotension; Neurally mediated hypotension; NMH
Low blood sodium,Low blood sodium is a condition in which the sodium level in the blood is lower than normal. The medical name of this condition is hyponatremia.,"Sodium is found mostly in the body fluids outside the cells. Sodium is an electrolyte (mineral). It is very important for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is also needed for nerves, muscles, and other body tissues to work properly. When the amount of sodium in fluids outside cells drops below normal, water moves into the cells. This causes the cells to swell with too much water. Brain cells are especially sensitive to swelling, and this causes many of the symptoms of low blood sodium. With hyponatremia, the imbalance of water to sodium is caused by one of three conditions: Euvolemic hyponatremia -- total body water increases, but the body's sodium content stays the same Hypervolemic hyponatremia -- both sodium and water content in the body increase, but the water gain is greater Hypovolemic hyponatremia -- water and sodium are both lost from the body, but the sodium loss is greater Low blood sodium can be caused by: Burns that affect a large area of the body Diarrhea Diuretic medicines (water pills), which increase urine output and loss of sodium through the urine Heart failure Kidney diseases Cirrhosis (advanced liver disease) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Sweating Vomiting","Common symptoms include: Confusion , irritability, restlessness Convulsions Fatigue Headache Loss of appetite Muscle weakness , spasms, or cramps Nausea, vomiting",,Hyponatremia; Dilutional hyponatremia; Euvolemic hyponatremia; Hypervolemic hyponatremia; Hypovolemic hyponatremia
Low blood sugar,Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when the body's blood sugar (glucose) decreases and is too low.,"Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells where it is stored or used for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into the cells. This leads to symptoms of diabetes . Low blood sugar occurs due to any of the following: Your body's glucose is used up too quickly Glucose production by the body is too low or it is released into the bloodstream too slowly Too much insulin is in the bloodstream Low blood sugar is common in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. However, many other diabetes medicines do not cause low blood sugar. Exercise can also lead to low blood sugar in people taking insulin to treat their diabetes. Babies born to mothers with diabetes may have severe drops in blood sugar right after birth. In people who do not have diabetes, low blood sugar may be caused by: Drinking alcohol Insulinoma , which is a rare tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin Lack of a hormone, such as cortisol, growth hormone, or thyroid hormone Severe heart, kidney, or liver failure Infection that affects the whole body ( sepsis ) Some types of weight-loss surgery (usually 5 or more years after the surgery) Medicines not used to treat diabetes (certain antibiotics or heart medicines)","Symptoms you may have when your blood sugar gets too low include: Double vision or blurry vision Fast or pounding heartbeat Feeling cranky or acting aggressive Feeling nervous Headache Hunger Seizures Shaking or trembling Sweating Tingling or numbness of the skin Tiredness or weakness Trouble sleeping Unclear thinking In many people with diabetes, low blood sugar causes nearly the same symptoms every time it happens. Not everybody feels low blood sugar symptoms the same way. Some symptoms, like hunger or sweating, occur when blood sugar is only slightly low. More severe symptoms, such as unclear thinking or seizure, may occur when the blood sugar is much lower (less than 54 mg/dL or 3.0 mmol/L). Even if you do not have symptoms, your blood sugar could still be too low (called hypoglycemic unawareness). You may not even know you have low blood sugar until you faint, have a seizure, or go into a coma . If you have diabetes, ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low to help prevent a medical emergency. Some continuous glucose monitors can alert you and other people that you designate when your blood sugar decreases below a set level. If you have diabetes, keeping good control of your blood sugar can help prevent low blood sugar. Talk to your provider if you're not sure about the causes and symptoms of low blood sugar.",,Hypoglycemia; Insulin shock; Insulin reaction; Diabetes - hypoglycemia
Low blood sugar - newborns,A low blood sugar level in newborn babies is also called neonatal hypoglycemia. It refers to low blood sugar (glucose) in the first few days after birth.,"Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain. The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk, or from formula. The baby can also produce some glucose in the liver. The glucose level can drop if: There is too much insulin in the blood. Insulin is a hormone that moves glucose from the blood into tissues. The baby is not able to produce enough glucose. The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced. The baby is not able to take in enough glucose by feeding. Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the glucose level of a newborn causes symptoms or is below the range considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1000 births. Low blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors: Born early, has a serious infection, and/or needed oxygen right after delivery Mother has diabetes Slower than expected growth in the womb during pregnancy Smaller or larger in size than expected for their gestational age","Infants with low blood sugar may not have symptoms. If your baby has one of the risk factors for low blood sugar, nurses in the hospital will check your baby's blood sugar level, even if there are no symptoms. Also, the blood sugar level is usually checked for babies with these symptoms: Bluish-colored or pale skin Breathing problems, such as pauses in breathing (apnea), rapid breathing, or a grunting sound Irritability or listlessness Loose or floppy muscles Poor feeding or vomiting Problems keeping the body warm Tremors, shakiness, sweating, or seizures",,Neonatal hypoglycemia
Low calcium level  - infants,"Calcium is a mineral in the body. It is needed for strong bones and teeth. Calcium also helps the heart, nerves, muscles, and other body systems work well.","A healthy baby most often has very careful control of the blood calcium level by normal bodily systems. A low calcium level in the blood is more likely to occur in newborns, more commonly in those who were born too early (preemies). Common causes of hypocalcemia in a newborn include: Certain medicines Diabetes in the birth mother Episodes of very low oxygen levels Infection Stress caused by serious illness There are also some rare illnesses that can lead to low blood calcium level. These include: DiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disorder. The parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body. Rarely, a child is born with underactive parathyroid glands.","Babies with hypocalcemia often have no symptoms. Sometimes, babies with low blood calcium levels are jittery or have tremors or twitching. Rarely, they have seizures . These babies may also have a slow heart rate and low blood pressure.",,Hypocalcemia - infants

Lump in the abdomen,A lump in the abdomen is a small area of swelling or bulge of tissue in the belly.,"Most often, a lump in the abdomen is caused by a hernia. An abdominal hernia occurs when there is a weak spot in the abdominal wall. This allows the internal organs to bulge through the muscles of the abdomen. A hernia may appear after you strain, or lift something heavy, or after a long period of coughing. There are several types of hernias, based on where they occur: Inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin or scrotum. This type is more common in men than women. Incisional hernia can occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery. Umbilical hernia appears as a bulge around the belly button. It occurs when the muscle around the navel does not close completely.

Lung cancer,Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs.,"Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45. Smoking causes most cases (around 90%) of lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. But some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Research shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer. Constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include: Arsenic Asbestos Radon Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives Products using chloride and formaldehyde","Early lung cancer may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have, but may include: Chest pain Cough that does not go away Coughing up blood Fatigue Losing weight without trying Loss of appetite Shortness of breath Wheezing Other symptoms that may also occur with lung cancer, often in the late stages: Bone pain or tenderness Eyelid drooping Facial paralysis Hoarseness or changing voice Joint pain Nail problems Shoulder pain Swallowing difficulty Swelling of the face or arms Weakness These symptoms can also be due to other, less serious conditions, so it is important to talk to your health care provider.",,Cancer - lung
Lung cancer - small cell,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-growing type of lung cancer. It spreads much more quickly than non-small cell lung cancer.,"About 15% of all lung cancer cases are SCLC. Small cell lung cancer is slightly more common in men than women. Almost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is very rare in people who have never smoked. SCLC is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) in the center of the chest. Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors. These tumors often spread rapidly (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone.","Symptoms of SCLC include: Bloody sputum (phlegm) Chest pain Cough Loss of appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss Wheezing Other symptoms that may occur with this disease, especially in the late stages, include: Facial swelling Fever Hoarseness or changing voice Swallowing difficulty Weakness",,Cancer - lung - small cell; Small cell lung cancer; SCLC

Lupus nephritis,"Lupus nephritis, which is a kidney disorder, is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is an autoimmune disease . This means there is a problem with the body's immune system. Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues. SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead to disorders such as: Interstitial nephritis Nephrotic syndrome Membranous glomerulonephritis Kidney failure",Symptoms of lupus nephritis include: Blood in the urine Foamy appearance to urine Swelling (edema) of any area of the body High blood pressure,,Nephritis - lupus; Lupus glomerular disease

Lyme disease,Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread through the bite of one of several types of ticks.,"Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi ( B burgdorferi ). Blacklegged ticks (also called deer ticks) can carry these bacteria. Not all species of ticks can carry these bacteria. Immature ticks are called nymphs, and they are about the size of a pinhead. Nymphs pick up bacteria when they feed on small rodents, such as mice, infected with B burgdorferi . You can only get the disease if you are bitten by an infected tick. Lyme disease was first reported in the United States in 1977 in the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut. The same disease occurs in many parts of Europe and Asia. In the United States, most Lyme disease infections occur in the following areas: Northeastern states, from Virginia to Maine North-central states, mostly in Wisconsin and Minnesota West Coast, mainly in the northwest There are three stages of Lyme disease. Stage 1 is called early localized Lyme disease. The bacteria have not yet spread throughout the body. Stage 2 is called early disseminated Lyme disease. The bacteria have begun to spread throughout the body. Stage 3 is called late disseminated Lyme disease. The bacteria have spread throughout the body. Risk factors for Lyme disease include: Doing outside activities that increase tick exposure (for example, gardening, hunting, or hiking) in an area where Lyme disease occurs Having a pet that may carry infected ticks home Walking in high grasses in areas where Lyme disease occurs Important facts about tick bites and Lyme disease: A tick must be attached to your body for 24 to 36 hours in order to spread the bacteria to your blood. Blacklegged ticks can be so small that they are almost impossible to see. Many people with Lyme disease never even see or feel a tick on their body. Most people who are bitten by a tick do not get Lyme disease.","Symptoms of early localized Lyme disease (stage 1) begin days or weeks after infection. They are similar to the flu and may include: Fever and chills General ill feeling Headache Joint pain Muscle pain Stiff neck There may be a ""bull's eye"" rash, a flat or slightly raised red spot at the site of the tick bite. Often there is a clear area in the center. It can be large and expanding in size. This rash is called erythema migrans. Without treatment, it can last 4 weeks or longer. Symptoms may come and go. Untreated, the bacteria can spread to the brain, heart, and joints. Symptoms of early disseminated Lyme disease (stage 2) may occur weeks to months after the tick bite, and may include: Numbness or pain in the nerve area Paralysis or weakness in the muscles of the face Heart problems, such as conduction abnormalities (e.g. skipped heartbeats or palpitations ), chest pain, or shortness of breath Symptoms of late disseminated Lyme disease (stage 3) can occur months or years after the infection. The most common symptoms are muscle and joint pain. Other symptoms may include: Abnormal muscle movement Joint swelling Muscle weakness Numbness and tingling Speech problems Thinking (cognitive) problems",,Borreliosis; Bannwarth syndrome

It is a complication of certain bacterial infections.,"The lymph system (lymphatics) is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. The lymph glands, or lymph nodes, are small structures that filter the lymph fluid. There are many white blood cells in the lymph nodes to help fight infection. Lymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation. Lymphadenitis may occur after skin infections or other infections caused by bacteria such as streptococcus or staphylococcus. Sometimes, it is caused by rare infections such as tuberculosis or cat scratch disease (bartonella).","Symptoms may include: Red, tender skin over lymph node Swollen, tender, or hard lymph nodes Fever Lymph nodes may feel rubbery if an abscess (pocket of pus) has formed or they have become inflamed.",,Lymph node infection; Lymph gland infection; Localized lymphadenopathy

Other causes of lymphatic obstruction include: Infections with parasites, such as filariasis Injury Radiation therapy Skin infections, such as cellulitis (more common in obese people) Surgery Tumors A common cause of lymphedema is removal of the breast ( mastectomy ) and underarm lymph tissue for breast cancer treatment. This causes lymphedema of the arm in some people, because the lymphatic drainage of the arm passes through the armpit (axilla). Rare forms of lymphedema that are present from birth (congenital) may result from problems in the development of the lymphatic vessels.","The main symptom is persistent (chronic) swelling, usually of the arm or leg.",,Lymphedema

Malabsorption,Malabsorption involves problems with the body's ability to take in (absorb) nutrients from food.,"Many diseases can cause malabsorption. Most often, malabsorption involves problems absorbing certain sugars, fats, proteins, or vitamins. It can also involve an overall problem with absorbing food. Problems or damage to the small intestine that may lead to problems absorbing important nutrients. These include: Celiac disease Tropical sprue Crohn disease Whipple disease Damage from radiation treatments Overgrowth of bacteria in the small bowel Parasite or tapeworm infection Surgery that removes all or part of the small intestine Enzymes produced by the pancreas help absorb fats and other nutrients. A decrease of these enzymes makes it harder to absorb fats and certain nutrients. Problems with the pancreas may be caused by: Cystic fibrosis Infections or swelling of the pancreas Trauma to the pancreas Surgery to remove part of the pancreas Some of the other causes of malabsorption include: AIDS and HIV Certain medicines (tetracycline, some antacids, some medicines used to treat obesity, colchicine, acarbose, phenytoin, cholestyramine) Gastrectomy and surgical treatments for obesity Cholestasis Chronic liver disease Cow's milk protein intolerance Soy milk protein intolerance","In children, the current weight or rate of weight gain is often much lower than that of other children of similar age and sex. This is called failure to thrive . The child may not grow and develop normally. Adults may also have failure to thrive, with weight loss, muscle wasting, weakness, and even problems thinking.

Malaria,"Malaria is a parasitic disease that involves high fevers, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia.","Malaria is caused by a parasite. It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs). The parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours. Most symptoms are caused by: The release of merozoites into the bloodstream Anemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells Large amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys Malaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter. The disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates. In some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides. In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease.","Symptoms include: Anemia (condition in which the body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells) Bloody stools Chills, fever, sweating Coma Convulsions Headache Jaundice Muscle pain Nausea and vomiting",,Quartan malaria; Falciparum malaria; Biduoterian fever; Blackwater fever; Tertian malaria; Plasmodium

Male pattern baldness,Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men.,"Male pattern baldness is related to your genes and male sex hormones. It usually follows a pattern of receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown. Each strand of hair sits in a tiny hole (cavity) in the skin called a follicle. Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair.","The typical pattern of male baldness begins at the hairline in the front of the head. The hairline gradually moves backward (recedes) and forms an ""M"" shape. A circular area on the back of the head (vertex) often thins and expands in size over time. Eventually the hair becomes finer, shorter, and thinner, and creates a U-shaped (or horseshoe) pattern of hair around the sides of the head and a bald area on the back of the head.",,Alopecia in men; Baldness - male; Hair loss in men; Androgenetic alopecia

Malignant mesothelioma,Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon cancerous tumor. It mainly affects the lining of the lung and chest cavity (pleura) or lining of the abdomen (peritoneum). It is due to long-term asbestos exposure.,"Long-term exposure to asbestos is the biggest risk factor. Asbestos is a fire-resistant material. It was once commonly found in insulation, ceiling and roofing vinyls, cement, and car brakes. Even though many asbestos workers smoked, experts do not believe smoking itself is a cause of this condition. Older veterans make up 30% of the cases of mesothelioma due to exposure in the military ship, vehicle, and plane industry. Men are affected more often than women. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years. Most people seem to develop the condition about 30 years after being in contact with the asbestos.","Symptoms may not appear until 20 to 40 years or longer after exposure to asbestos, and may include: Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Chest pain , especially when taking a deep breath Cough Fatigue Shortness of breath Weight loss Fever and sweating",,Mesothelioma - malignant; Malignant pleura mesothelioma (MPM)

Malnutrition,Malnutrition is the condition that occurs when your body does not get enough nutrients.,"There are many types of malnutrition, and they have different causes. Some causes include: Poor diet Starvation due to food not being available Eating disorders Problems with digesting food or absorbing nutrients from food (malabsorption) Certain medical conditions that make a person unable to eat You may develop malnutrition if you lack a single vitamin in your diet. Lacking a vitamin or other nutrient is called a deficiency. Sometimes malnutrition is very mild and causes no symptoms. Other times it can be so severe that the damage it does to the body is permanent, even though you survive. Poverty, natural disasters, political problems, and war can all contribute to malnutrition and starvation, and not just in developing countries. Some health conditions that are related to malnutrition are: Malabsorption Hunger Beriberi Binge eating Deficiency - Vitamin A Deficiency - Vitamin B1 (thiamine) Deficiency - Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) Deficiency - Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) Deficiency - Vitamin B9 (folacin) Deficiency - Vitamin E Deficiency - Vitamin K Eating disorders Kwashiorkor Megaloblastic anemia Pellagra Rickets Scurvy Spina bifida Malnutrition is a significant problem all over the world, especially among children.

General symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss.",,Nutrition - inadequate
Malocclusion of teeth,Malocclusion means the teeth are not aligned properly.,"Occlusion refers to the alignment of teeth and the way that the upper and lower teeth fit together (bite). The upper teeth should fit slightly over the lower teeth. The points of the molars should fit the grooves of the opposite molar. The upper teeth keep you from biting your cheeks and lips, and your lower teeth protect your tongue. Malocclusion is most often hereditary. This means it is passed down through families. It may be caused by a difference between the size of the upper and lower jaws or between the jaw and tooth size. It causes tooth overcrowding or abnormal bite patterns. The shape of the jaws or birth defects such as cleft lip and palate may also be reasons for malocclusion. Other causes include: Childhood habits such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond age 3, and prolonged use of a bottle Extra teeth, lost teeth, impacted teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth Ill-fitting dental fillings, crowns, dental appliances, retainers, or braces Misalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury Tumors of the mouth and jaw There are different categories of malocclusion: Class 1 malocclusion is the most common. The bite is normal, but the upper teeth slightly overlap the lower teeth. Class 2 malocclusion, called retrognathism or overbite, occurs when the upper jaw and teeth severely overlap the bottom jaw and teeth. Class 3 malocclusion, called prognathism or underbite, occurs when the lower jaw protrudes or juts forward, causing the lower jaw and teeth to overlap the upper jaw and teeth.","Symptoms of malocclusion are: Abnormal alignment of teeth Abnormal appearance of the face Difficulty or discomfort when biting or chewing Speech difficulties (rare), including lisp Mouth breathing (breathing through the mouth without closing the lips) Inability to bite into food correctly (open bite)",,Crowded teeth; Misaligned teeth; Crossbite; Overbite; Underbite; Open bite

Maple syrup urine disease,Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a disorder in which the body cannot break down certain parts of proteins. The urine of people with this condition can smell like maple syrup.,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. It is caused by a defect in 1 of 3 genes. People with this condition cannot break down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the blood. In the most severe form, MSUD can damage the brain during times of physical stress (such as infection, fever, or not eating for a long time). Some types of MSUD are mild or come and go. Even in the mildest form, repeated periods of physical stress can cause intellectual disability and high levels of leucine to build up.",Symptoms of this disorder include: Coma Feeding difficulties Lethargy Seizures Urine that smells like maple syrup Vomiting,,MSUD
Marfan syndrome,Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissue. This is the tissue that strengthens the body's structures.,"Marfan syndrome is caused by variants in a gene called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 plays an important role as the building block for connective tissue in the body. The gene variant also causes the long bones of the body to grow too much. People with this syndrome have tall height and long arms and legs. How this overgrowth happens is not well understood. Other areas of the body that are affected include: Lung tissue (there may be a pneumothorax, in which air can escape from the lung into the chest cavity and collapse the lung) The aorta, the main blood vessel that takes blood from the heart to the body may stretch or become weak (called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm) The heart valves The eyes, causing cataracts and other problems (such as a dislocation of the lenses) The skin Tissue covering the spinal cord The joints In most cases, Marfan syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). However, up to 30% of people have no family history, which is called ""sporadic."" In sporadic cases, the syndrome is believed to be caused by a new gene change.","People with Marfan syndrome are often tall with long, thin arms and legs and spider-like fingers (called arachnodactyly). The length of the arms is greater than height when arms are stretched out. Other symptoms include: A chest that sinks in or sticks out, called funnel chest ( pectus excavatum ) or pigeon breast ( pectus carinatum ) Flat feet Highly arched palate and crowded teeth Hypotonia of muscles (low muscle tone) Joints that are too flexible (but the elbows may be less flexible) Learning disability Movement of the lens of the eye from its normal position (dislocation) Nearsightedness Small lower jaw (micrognathia) Spine that curves to one side ( scoliosis ) Thin, narrow face Many people with Marfan syndrome suffer from chronic muscle and joint pain.",,Aortic aneurysm - Marfan

Measles,Measles is a very contagious (easily spread) illness caused by a virus.,"Measles is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected person. Sneezing and coughing can put contaminated droplets into the air. If one person has the measles, 90% of the people who come in contact with that person will get the measles, unless they have been vaccinated. People who had measles or who have been vaccinated against measles are protected from the disease. As of 2000, measles had been eliminated in the United States. However, unvaccinated people who travel to other countries where measles is common have brought the disease back to the United States. This has led to recent outbreaks of measles in groups of people who are unvaccinated. Some parents do not let their children get vaccinated. This is because of unfounded fears that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, can cause autism. Parents and caregivers should know that: Large studies of thousands of children have found no connection between this or any vaccine and autism. Reviews by all major health organizations in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere all found NO LINK between the MMR vaccine and autism. The study that had first reported a risk of autism from this vaccine has been proven to be fraudulent.","Symptoms of measles usually begin 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. This is called the incubation period. Rash is often the main symptom. The rash: Usually appears 3 to 5 days after the first signs of being sick May last 4 to 7 days Usually starts on the head and spreads to other areas, moving down the body May appear as flat, discolored areas ( macules ) and solid, red, raised areas ( papules ) that later join together Itches Other symptoms may include: Bloodshot eyes Cough Fever Light sensitivity ( photophobia ) Muscle pain Red and inflamed eyes ( conjunctivitis ) Runny nose Sore throat Tiny white spots inside the mouth (Koplik spots)",,Rubeola
Meatal stenosis,"Meatal stenosis is a narrowing of the opening of the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.","Meatal stenosis can affect both males and females. It is more common in males. In males, it is often caused by swelling and irritation (inflammation). In most cases, this problem occurs in newborns after circumcision . Abnormal scar tissue can grow across the opening of the urethra, causing it to narrow. The problem may not be detected until the child is toilet trained. In adult men, the condition can result from surgery on the urethra, ongoing use of an indwelling catheter , or a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate gland ( BPH ).

Meconium aspiration syndrome,Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) refers to breathing problems that a newborn baby may have when:,"Meconium is the early stool passed by a newborn soon after birth, before the baby starts to feed and digest milk or formula. In some cases, the baby passes meconium while still inside the uterus. This can happen when babies are ""under stress"" due to a decrease in blood and oxygen supply. This is often due to problems with the placenta or the umbilical cord. Once the baby passes the meconium into the surrounding amniotic fluid, they may breathe it into the lungs. This may happen: While the baby is still in the uterus During delivery Immediately after birth The meconium can also block the infant's airways right after birth. It can cause breathing problems due to disrupting the balance of proteins normally present as well as causing swelling (inflammation) in the baby's lungs after birth and disrupting the normal changes of blood flow between the heart and lungs following birth. Risk factors that may cause stress on the baby before birth include: ""Aging"" of the placenta if the pregnancy goes far past the due date Decreased oxygen to the infant while in the uterus Diabetes in the pregnant mother Difficult delivery or long labor High blood pressure in the pregnant mother Infection in the placenta affecting the baby","Most babies who have passed meconium into the amniotic fluid do not breathe it into their lungs during labor and delivery.

Mediastinal tumor,Mediastinal tumors are growths that form in the mediastinum. This is an area in the middle of the chest that separates the lungs.,"The mediastinum is the part of the chest that lies between the sternum and the spinal column, and between the lungs. This area contains the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe (trachea), thymus gland, esophagus, and connective tissues. The mediastinum is divided into three sections: Anterior (front) Middle Posterior (back) Mediastinal tumors are rare. The most common location for tumors in the mediastinum depends on the age of the person. In children, tumors are more common in the posterior mediastinum. These tumors often begin in the nerves and are noncancerous (benign). Most mediastinal tumors in adults occur in the anterior mediastinum. They are usually cancerous (malignant) lymphomas, germ cell tumors, or thymomas (cancers of the thymus). These tumors are most common in middle aged and older adults.",Almost one half of mediastinal tumors cause no symptoms and are found on a chest x-ray done for another reason. Symptoms that do occur are due to pressure on (compression of) local structures and may include: Chest pain Fever and chills Cough Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) Hoarseness Night sweats Shortness of breath,,Thymoma - mediastinal; Lymphoma - mediastinal
Mediastinitis,"Mediastinitis is swelling and irritation (inflammation) of the chest area between the lungs (mediastinum). This area contains the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe (trachea), food tube (esophagus), thymus gland, lymph nodes, and connective tissue.","Mediastinitis usually results from an infection. It may occur suddenly ( acute ), or it may develop slowly and get worse over time ( chronic ). It most often occurs in person who recently had an upper endoscopy or chest surgery. A person may have a tear in their esophagus that causes mediastinitis. Causes of the tear include: A procedure such as upper GI endoscopy Forceful or constant vomiting Trauma Other causes of mediastinitis include: A fungal infection called histoplasmosis Radiation to the chest Inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues ( sarcoidosis ) Tuberculosis Breathing in anthrax Cancer Risk factors include: Disease of the esophagus Diabetes mellitus Problems in the upper gastrointestinal tract Recent chest surgery or upper GI endoscopy Weakened immune system",Symptoms may include: Chest pain Chills Fever General discomfort Shortness of breath Signs of mediastinitis in people who have had recent surgery include: Chest wall tenderness Wound drainage Unstable chest wall,,Chest infection

Medicines for back pain,"Acute back pain often goes away on its own over several weeks. In some people, back pain persists. It may not go away completely or it may get more painful at times.",,,,
Meibomianitis,"Meibomianitis is inflammation of the meibomian glands, a group of oil-releasing (sebaceous) glands in the eyelids. These glands have tiny openings to release oils onto the surface of the cornea.","Any condition that increases the oily secretions of the meibomian glands will allow excess oils to build up on the edges of the eyelids. This allows for the excess growth of bacteria that are normally present on the skin. These problems can be caused by allergies, hormone changes during adolescence, or skin conditions such as rosacea and acne. Meibomianitis is often associated with blepharitis , which can cause a buildup of a dandruff-like substance at the base of the eyelashes. In some people with meibomianitis, the glands will be plugged so that there is less oil being made for the normal tear film. These people often have symptoms of dry eyes.",Symptoms include: Swelling and redness of eyelid edges Symptoms of dry eye Slight blurring of vision due to excess oil in tears -- most often cleared by blinking Frequent styes,,Meibomian gland dysfunction
Melanin,Melanin is a natural substance that gives color (pigment) to:,,,,
Melanoma,Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. It is also the rarest. It is the leading cause of death from skin disease.,"Melanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color. Melanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma. There are four major types of melanoma: Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown. It is most common in fair skin people. Nodular melanoma usually starts as a raised area that is dark blackish-blue or bluish-red. Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma). Lentigo maligna melanoma usually occurs in older people. It is most common in sun-damaged skin on the face, neck, and arms. The abnormal skin areas are usually large, flat, and tan with areas of brown. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the least common form. It usually occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails. The risk for developing melanoma increases with age. However, more and more young people are developing it. You are more likely to develop melanoma if you: Have fair skin, blue or green eyes, or red or blond hair Live in sunny climates or at high altitudes Spent a lot of time in high levels of strong sunlight because of a job or other activities Have had one or more blistering sunburns during childhood Use tanning devices, such as tanning beds Other risk factors include: Having close relatives with melanoma Certain types of moles (atypical or dysplastic) or many birthmarks Weakened immune system due to disease or medicines","A mole, sore, lump, or growth on the skin can be a sign of melanoma or other skin cancer. A sore or growth that bleeds, or changes in color can also be a sign of skin cancer. The ABCDE system can help you remember possible symptoms of melanoma: A symmetry: One half of the abnormal area is different from the other half. B orders: The edges of the growth are irregular. C olor: Color changes from one area to another, with shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes white, red, or blue. A mixture of colors may appear within one sore. D iameter: The spot is usually (but not always) larger than 5 mm in diameter -- about the size of a pencil eraser. E volution: The mole keeps changing appearance. Another way to look for possible melanoma is the ""ugly duckling sign."" This means the melanoma does not look like any of the other spots on the body. It stands out like the ugly duckling in the children's story.",,Skin cancer - melanoma; Malignant melanoma; Lentigo maligna melanoma; Melanoma in situ; Superficial spreading melanoma; Nodular melanoma; Acral lentiginous melanoma
Melanoma of the eye,Melanoma of the eye is cancer that occurs in various parts of the eye.,"Melanoma is a very aggressive type of cancer that can spread rapidly. It usually is a type of skin cancer. Melanoma of the eye can affect several parts of the eye, including the: Choroid Ciliary body Conjunctiva Eyelid Iris Orbit The choroid layer is the most likely site of melanoma in the eye. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the white of the eye and retina (back of the eye). The cancer may only be in the eye. Or, it may spread (metastasize) to another location in the body, most commonly the liver. Melanoma can also begin on the skin or other organs in the body and spread to the eye. Melanoma is the most common type of eye tumor in adults. Even so, melanoma that starts in the eye is rare. Too much exposure to sunlight is an important risk factor for melanoma. People who have fair skin and blue eyes are most affected.","Symptoms of melanoma of the eye may include any of the following: Bulging eyes Change in iris color Poor vision in one eye Red, painful eye Small defect on the iris or conjunctiva In some cases, there may be no symptoms.",,Malignant melanoma - choroid; Malignant melanoma - eye; Eye tumor; Ocular melanoma
Melasma,Melasma is a skin condition that causes patches of dark skin on areas of the face exposed to the sun.,"Melasma is a common skin disorder. It most often appears in young women with brownish skin tone, but it can affect anyone. Melasma is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. It is common in: Pregnant women Women taking birth control pills ( oral contraceptives ) Women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause. Being in the sun makes melasma more likely to develop. The problem is more common in tropical climates.","The only symptom of melasma is a change in skin color. However, this color change can cause distress about your appearance. The skin color changes are most often an even brown color. They often appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. Dark patches are often symmetrical.",,Chloasma; Mask of pregnancy; Pregnancy mask
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a kidney disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells. It may lead to kidney failure.,"Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli. The glomeruli of the kidney help filter wastes and fluids from the blood to form urine. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by an abnormal immune response . Deposits of antibodies build up in a part of the kidneys called the glomerular basement membrane. This membrane helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood. Damage to this membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally. It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling ( edema ). Nitrogen waste products may also build up in the blood ( azotemia ). The 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II. Most people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I. Causes of MPGN may include: Autoimmune diseases ( systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , Sjögren syndrome , sarcoidosis ) Cancer (leukemia, lymphoma) Infections ( hepatitis B , hepatitis C , endocarditis , malaria )","Symptoms may include any of the following: Blood in the urine Changes in mental status such as decreased alertness or decreased concentration Cloudy urine Dark urine (smoke, cola, or tea colored) Decrease in urine volume Swelling of any part of the body",,Membranoproliferative GN I; Membranoproliferative GN II; Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis; Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; Lobular GN; Glomerulonephritis - membranoproliferative; MPGN type I; MPGN type II
Membranous nephropathy,Membranous nephropathy is a kidney disorder that leads to changes and inflammation of the structures inside the kidney that help filter wastes and fluids. The inflammation may lead to problems with kidney function.,"Membranous nephropathy is caused by the thickening of a part of the glomerular basement membrane. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The exact reason for this thickening is not known. The thickened glomerular membrane does not work normally. As a result, large amounts of protein are lost in the urine. This condition is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome . This is a group of symptoms and abnormal test results that include protein in the urine, low blood protein level, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, increased blood clot risk, and swelling. Membranous nephropathy may be a primary kidney disease, or it may be associated with other conditions. The following increase your risk for this condition: Cancers, especially lung and colon cancer Exposure to toxins, including gold and mercury Infections, including hepatitis B , malaria , syphilis, and endocarditis Medicines, including penicillamine, trimethadione, and skin-lightening creams Systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, and other autoimmune disorders The disorder occurs at any age, but is more common after age 40.","Symptoms often begin slowly over time, and may include: Edema (swelling) in any area of the body Fatigue Foamy appearance of urine (due to large amounts of protein) Poor appetite Urination, excessive at night Weight gain",,Membranous glomerulonephritis; Membranous GN; Extramembranous glomerulonephritis; Glomerulonephritis - membranous; MGN
Memory loss,"Memory loss is unusual forgetfulness. You may not be able to remember new events, recall one or more memories of the past, or both.","Normal aging can cause some forgetfulness. It is normal to have some trouble learning new material or needing more time to remember it. But normal aging does not lead to dramatic memory loss. Such memory loss is due to other diseases. Memory loss can be caused by many things. To determine a cause, your health care provider will ask if the problem came on suddenly or slowly. Many areas of the brain help you create and retrieve memories. A problem in any of these areas can lead to memory loss. Memory loss may result from a new injury to the brain, which is caused by or is present after: Brain tumor Cancer treatment, such as brain radiation , bone marrow transplant , or chemotherapy Concussion or head trauma Not enough oxygen getting to the brain when your heart or breathing is stopped for too long Severe brain infection or infection around the brain Major surgery or severe illness, including brain surgery Sudden, temporary loss of memory (transient global amnesia) of unclear cause Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke Fluid collection in the brain ( hydrocephalus ) Multiple sclerosis Dementia Sometimes, memory loss occurs with mental health problems, such as: After a major, traumatic or stressful event Bipolar disorder Depression or other mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia Memory loss may be a sign of dementia. Dementia also affects thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. Common types of dementia associated with memory loss are: Alzheimer disease Vascular dementia Lewy body dementia Fronto-temporal dementia Progressive supranuclear palsy Normal pressure hydrocephalus Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Other causes of memory loss include: Alcohol or use of prescription or illegal drugs Brain infections such as Lyme disease , syphilis , or HIV/AIDS Overuse of medicines, such as barbiturates, opioids or hypnotics Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) most often causes short-term memory loss Epilepsy that is not well controlled Illness that results in the loss of, or damage to brain tissue or nerve cells, such as Parkinson disease , Huntington disease , or multiple sclerosis Low levels of important nutrients or vitamins, such as low vitamin B1 or B12",,"A person with memory loss needs a lot of support. It helps to show the person familiar objects, music, or and photos or play familiar music. It is important to write down when the person should take any medicine or do other critical tasks.

It may occur when the pressure of the fluid in part of the inner ear gets too high. In some cases, Ménière disease may be related to: Head injury Middle or inner ear infection Other risk factors include: Alcohol use Allergies Family history Recent cold or viral illness Smoking Stress Use of certain medicines Ménière disease is a fairly common disorder.","Attacks of Ménière disease often start without warning. They may occur daily or as rarely as once a year. The severity of each attack can vary. Some attacks may be severe and interfere with daily living activities. Ménière disease usually has four main symptoms: Hearing loss that varies over time Pressure in the ear Ringing or roaring in the affected ear, called tinnitus Vertigo, or dizziness Severe vertigo is the symptom that causes the most problems. With vertigo, you feel as though you are spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around you. Nausea, vomiting, and sweating often occur. Symptoms get worse with sudden movement. Often, you will need to lie down and close your eyes. You may feel dizzy and off-balance for anywhere from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Hearing loss is often only in one ear, but it may affect both ears. Hearing tends to improve between attacks, but gets worse over time. Low frequency hearing is lost first. You also may have roaring or ringing in the ear (tinnitus), along with a sense of pressure in your ear.

These infections usually get better without treatment. But, bacterial meningitis infections are very serious. They may result in death or brain damage, even if treated. A lumbar puncture (or spinal tap) is required to determine the specific cause. Meningitis may also be caused by: Chemical irritation Drug allergies Fungi Parasites Tumors Many types of viruses can cause meningitis: Enteroviruses: These are viruses that also can cause intestinal illness. Herpes viruses: These are the same viruses that can cause cold sores and genital herpes . However, people with cold sores or genital herpes do not have a higher chance of developing herpes meningitis. HIV. Mumps virus.

Menkes disease,"Menkes disease is a genetic disorder in which the body has a problem absorbing and distributing copper to bodily organs. The disease affects development, both mental and physical.","Menkes disease is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to properly distribute (transport) copper throughout the body. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper, while it builds up in the small intestine and kidneys. A low copper level can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function. Menkes syndrome is usually inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X-chromosome, so if a mother carries the defective gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. This kind of gene inheritance is called X-linked recessive . In some people, the disease is not inherited from their parents. Instead, the gene defect occurs at the time the baby is conceived.","Common symptoms of Menkes disease in infants are: Brittle, kinky, steely, sparse, or tangled hair Pudgy, rosy cheeks, sagging facial skin Feeding difficulties Irritability Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), floppiness Low body temperature Intellectual disability and developmental delay Seizures Skeletal changes",,Steely hair disease; Menkes kinky hair syndrome; Kinky hair disease; Copper transport disease; Trichopoliodystrophy; X-linked copper deficiency
Menopause,"Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her periods (menstruation) stop. Most often, it is a natural, normal body change that occurs between ages 45 to 55. After menopause, a woman can no longer become pregnant.","During menopause, a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs. Her body produces less of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Lower levels of these hormones cause menopause symptoms. Periods occur less often and eventually stop. Sometimes this happens suddenly. But most of the time, periods slowly stop over time. Menopause is complete when you have not had a period for 1 year. This is called postmenopause. Surgical menopause takes place when surgical treatments cause a drop in estrogen. This can happen if both of your ovaries are removed. Menopause can also sometimes be caused by drugs used for chemotherapy or hormone therapy (HT) for breast cancer.","Symptoms vary from woman to woman. They may last 5 or more years. Symptoms may be worse for some women than others. Symptoms of surgical menopause can be more severe and start more suddenly. The first thing you may notice is that periods start to change.

Mercury poisoning,This article discusses poisoning from mercury.,,"ELEMENTAL MERCURY Elemental mercury is usually harmless if it is touched or swallowed. It is so thick and slippery that it usually falls off the skin or leaves the stomach and intestines without being absorbed. A lot of damage can occur, though, if elemental mercury gets into the air in the form of small droplets that are breathed into the lungs. This often occurs by mistake when people try to vacuum up mercury that has spilled onto the ground. Breathing in enough elemental mercury will cause symptoms right away. These are called acute symptoms. Long-term symptoms will occur if small amounts are inhaled over time. These are called chronic symptoms. Chronic symptoms may include: Metallic taste in the mouth Vomiting Difficulty breathing Bad cough Swollen, bleeding gums Depending on how much mercury is inhaled, permanent lung damage and death may occur. Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur. There have been cases of mercury being injected under the skin, which can cause fever and rash. Infection may develop, requiring surgical drainage and removal of the mercury. INORGANIC MERCURY Unlike elemental mercury, inorganic mercury is usually poisonous when swallowed. Depending on how much is swallowed, symptoms may include: Burning in the stomach and throat Bloody diarrhea and vomiting If inorganic mercury enters your bloodstream, it can attack the kidneys and brain. Permanent kidney damage and kidney failure may occur. A large amount in the bloodstream may cause massive blood and fluid loss from diarrhea and kidney failure, leading to death. ORGANIC MERCURY Organic mercury can cause sickness if it is breathed in, eaten, or placed on the skin over long periods of time. Usually, organic mercury causes problems over years or decades, not right away. This means that being exposed to small amounts of organic mercury every day for years will likely cause symptoms to appear later. A single large exposure, however, can also cause problems. Long-term exposure will likely cause symptoms in the nervous system, including: Numbness or pain in certain parts of your skin Uncontrollable shaking or tremor Inability to walk well Blindness and double vision Memory problems Seizures and death (with large exposures) Being exposed to large amounts of the organic mercury called methylmercury while pregnant may cause permanent brain damage in the baby. Most health care providers recommend eating less fish, especially high-mercury fish such as swordfish, while pregnant, and limiting the consumption of such fish by small children as well. Women should talk to their provider about what they should and should not eat while pregnant.",,

Mesenteric angiography,Mesenteric angiography is a test used to look at the blood vessels that supply the small and large intestines.,,,,Abdominal arteriogram; Arteriogram - abdomen; Mesenteric angiogram
Mesenteric artery ischemia,Mesenteric artery ischemia occurs when there is a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the three major arteries that supply the small and large intestines. These are called the mesenteric arteries.,"The arteries that supply blood to the intestines run directly from the aorta. The aorta is the main artery from the heart. Hardening of the arteries occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. This is more common in smokers and in people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol. This narrows the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the intestines. Like every other part of the body, blood brings oxygen to the intestines. When the oxygen supply is reduced, symptoms may occur. The blood supply to the intestines may be suddenly blocked by a blood clot ( embolus ). The clots most often come from the heart or aorta. These clots are more commonly seen in people with abnormal heart rhythm.",Symptoms caused by gradual hardening of the mesenteric arteries include: Abdominal pain after eating Diarrhea Symptoms of sudden (acute) mesenteric artery ischemia due to a traveling blood clot include: Sudden severe abdominal pain or bloating Diarrhea Vomiting Fever Nausea,,Mesenteric vascular disease; Ischemic colitis; Ischemic bowel - mesenteric; Dead bowel - mesenteric; Dead gut - mesenteric; Atherosclerosis - mesenteric artery; Hardening of the arteries - mesenteric artery; Ischemic necrosis - mesenteric artery
Mesenteric venous thrombosis,Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a blood clot in one or more of the major veins that drain blood from the intestine. The superior mesenteric vein is most commonly involved.,"MVT is a clot that blocks blood flow in a mesenteric vein. There are two such veins through which blood leaves the intestine. The condition stops the normal blood circulation of the intestine and can result in damage to the intestine. The exact cause of MVT is unknown. However, there are many diseases that can lead to MVT. Many of the diseases cause swelling (inflammation) of the tissues surrounding the veins, and include: Appendicitis Cancer of the abdomen Diverticulitis Liver disease with cirrhosis High blood pressure in the blood vessels of the liver Abdominal surgery or trauma Pancreatitis Inflammatory bowel disorders ( Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis) Heart failure People who have disorders that make the blood more likely to stick together (clot) have a higher risk for MVT and include: Protein C or S deficiencies Polycythemia vera Essential thrombocythemia Birth control pills and estrogen medicines also increase risk. MVT is more common in men than women. It mainly affects middle aged or older adults.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Abdominal pain , which may get worse after eating and over time Bloating Constipation Bloody diarrhea Fever Septic shock Lower gastrointestinal bleeding Vomiting and nausea",,MVT
Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic acidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids.,"Metabolic acidosis develops when too much acid is produced in the body. It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis: Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes). Hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea. Kidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis). Lactic acidosis. Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol. Severe dehydration . Lactic acidosis results from a buildup of lactic acid. Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. It can be caused by: Cancer Carbon monoxide poisoning Drinking too much alcohol Exercising vigorously for a very long time Liver failure Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Medicines, such as salicylates, metformin, anti-retrovirals MELAS (a very rare genetic mitochondrial disorder that affects energy production) Prolonged lack of oxygen from shock , heart failure , or severe anemia Seizures Sepsis -- severe illness due to infection with bacteria or other germs Severe asthma","Most symptoms are caused by the underlying disease or condition that is causing the metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death. In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition.",,Acidosis - metabolic
Metabolic neuropathies,Metabolic neuropathies are nerve disorders that occur with diseases that disrupt the chemical processes in the body.,"Nerve damage can be caused by many different things. Metabolic neuropathy may be caused by: A problem with the body's ability to use energy, often due to a lack of enough nutrients (nutritional deficiency) Dangerous substances (toxins) that build up in the body Diabetes is one of the most common causes of metabolic neuropathies. People who are at the highest risk for nerve damage ( diabetic neuropathy ) from diabetes include those who have: Damage to the kidneys or eyes Poorly controlled blood sugar The longer one has diabetes, the more likely they are to get neuropathy Other common causes of metabolic neuropathies include: Alcohol use disorder ( alcoholic neuropathy ) Low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) Kidney failure Inherited conditions, such as porphyria Severe infection throughout the body ( sepsis ) Thyroid disease Liver disease Vitamin deficiencies (including vitamins B12 , B6 , E , and B1 ) Some metabolic disorders are passed down through families (inherited), while others develop due to various diseases.","These symptoms occur because nerves cannot send proper signals to and from your brain: Difficulty feeling in any area of the body Difficulty using the arms or hands Difficulty using the legs or feet Difficulty walking Pain, burning feeling, a pins and needles feeling or shooting pains in any area of the body (nerve pain) Weakness in the face, arms, legs, or other areas of the body Dysautonomia, which affects the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system, resulting in symptoms such as rapid heart rate, exercise intolerance, low blood pressure when standing, abnormal sweat patterns, stomach problems, abnormal functioning of the pupils of the eye, and poor erection These symptoms often start in the toes and feet and move up the legs, eventually affecting the hands and arms.",,Neuropathy - metabolic
Metabolic syndrome,"Metabolic syndrome is a name for a group of risk factors that occur together and increase the chance of having coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.","Metabolic syndrome is very common in the United States. About one fourth of Americans are affected and risk increases with age and among certain ethnicities. Doctors are not sure whether the syndrome is due to one single cause. But many of the risks for the syndrome are related to obesity. Many people with metabolic syndrome used to be told they had pre-diabetes, early hypertension (high blood pressure) or mild hyperlipidemia (high fats in the blood). The two most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are: Extra weight around the middle and upper parts of the body (central obesity ). This body type may be described as ""apple-shaped."" Insulin resistance -- Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Insulin is needed to help control the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin resistance means that some cells in the body use insulin less effectively than normal. As a result, blood sugar level rises, which causes insulin production to rise. This may increase the amount of body fat. Other risk factors include: Aging Genes that make you more likely to develop this condition Changes in male, female, and stress hormones Lack of exercise People who have metabolic syndrome often have one or more other factors that may be linked with the condition, including: Increased risk for blood clotting Increased levels of blood substances that are a sign of inflammation throughout the body Small amounts of a protein called albumin in the urine",,,Insulin resistance syndrome; Syndrome X

Metachromatic leukodystrophy,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a genetic disorder that affects nerves, muscles, other organs, and behavior. It slowly gets worse over time.","MLD is usually caused by the lack of an important enzyme called arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Because this enzyme is missing, chemicals called sulfatides build up in the body and damage the nervous system, kidneys, gallbladder, and other organs. In particular, the chemicals damage the protective sheaths that surround nerve cells. The disease is passed down through families (inherited). You must get a copy of the defective gene from both of your parents to have the disease. Parents can each have the defective gene, but not have MLD. A person with one defective gene is called a ""carrier."" Children who inherit only one defective gene from one parent will be a carrier, but usually will not develop MLD. When two carriers have a child, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will get both genes and have MLD. There are three forms of MLD. The forms are based on when the symptoms begin: Late infantile MLD symptoms usually begin by ages 1 to 2. Juvenile MLD symptoms usually begin between ages 4 and 12. Adult (and late-stage juvenile MLD) symptoms may occur between age 14 and adulthood (over age 16), but may begin as late as the 40s or 50s.","Symptoms of MLD may include any of the following: Abnormally high or decreased muscle tone, or abnormal muscle movements, any of which may cause problems walking or frequent falls Behavior problems, personality changes, irritability Decreased mental function Difficulty swallowing Inability to perform normal tasks Incontinence Poor school performance Seizures Speech difficulties, slurring",,MLD; Arylsulfatase A deficiency; Leukodystrophy - metachromatic; ARSA deficiency

Metastasis,Metastasis is the movement or spreading of cancer cells from one organ or tissue to another. Cancer cells usually spread through the blood or the lymph system.,,,,Metastatic cancer; Cancer metastases
Metastatic brain tumor,A metastatic brain tumor is cancer that started in another part of the body and has spread to the brain.,"Many tumor or cancer types can spread to the brain. The most common are: Lung cancer Breast cancer Melanoma Kidney cancer Some types of cancer rarely spread to the brain, such as prostate and colon cancer. In some cases, a tumor can spread to the brain from an unknown location. This is called cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Growing brain tumors can place pressure on nearby parts of the brain. Brain swelling due to these tumors also causes increased pressure within the skull . Brain tumors that spread are classified based on the location of the tumor in the brain, the type of tissue involved, and the original location of the tumor. Metastatic brain tumors occur in about one fourth (25%) of all cancers that spread through the body. They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain).","Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased coordination , clumsiness, falls General ill feeling or fatigue Headache , new or more severe than usual Memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems Numbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation Personality changes Rapid emotional changes or strange behaviors Seizures that are new Problems with speech Vision changes , double vision, decreased vision Vomiting, with or without nausea Weakness of a body area Specific symptoms vary.

Metatarsus adductus,Metatarsus adductus is a foot deformity that occurs in infants. The bones in the front half of the foot bend or turn in toward the side of the big toe.,"Metatarsus adductus is thought to be caused by the infant's position inside the womb. Risks may include: The baby's bottom was pointed down in the womb (breech position). The mother had a condition called oligohydramnios, in which she did not produce enough amniotic fluid . There may also be a family history of the condition. Metatarsus adductus is a fairly common problem. It is one of the reasons why people develop ""in-toeing."" Newborns with metatarsus adductus may also have a problem called developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), which allows the thigh bone to slip out of the hip socket.",The front of the foot is bent or angled in toward the middle of the foot.

Methemoglobinemia,Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a blood disorder in which an abnormal amount of methemoglobin is produced. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that carries and distributes oxygen to the body. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin.,"The MetHb condition can be: Passed down through families (inherited or congenital) Caused by exposure to certain medicines, chemicals, or foods (acquired) There are two forms of inherited MetHb. The first form is passed on by both parents due to genetic variants in both. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves. They carry the gene that causes the condition. It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase . There are two types of inherited MetHb: Type 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when RBCs lack the enzyme. Type 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work in the body. The second form of inherited MetHb is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the variant gene for the child to inherit the disease. Acquired MetHb is more common than the inherited forms. It occurs in some people after they are exposed to certain chemicals and medicines, including: Anesthetics such as benzocaine Nitrobenzene Certain antibiotics (including dapsone and chloroquine) Nitrites (used as additives to prevent meat from spoiling)",Symptoms of type 1 MetHb include: Bluish coloring of the skin (called cyanosis ) Symptoms of type 2 MetHb include: Developmental delay Failure to thrive Intellectual disability Seizures Symptoms of hemoglobin M disease include: Bluish coloring of the skin Symptoms of acquired MetHb include: Bluish coloring of the skin Headache Giddiness Altered mental state Fatigue Shortness of breath Lack of energy,,Hemoglobin M disease; Erythrocyte reductase deficiency; Generalized reductase deficiency; MetHb

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),"MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is a ""staph"" germ (bacteria) that does not get better with the type of antibiotics that usually cure staph infections.","Most staph germs are spread by skin-to-skin contact (touching). A doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or visitors to a hospital may have staph germs on their body that can spread to a patient. Once the staph germ enters the body, it can spread to bones, joints, the blood, or any organ, such as the lungs, heart, or brain. Serious staph infections are more common in people with chronic (long-term) medical problems. These include those who: Are in hospitals and long-term care facilities for a long time Are on kidney dialysis (hemodialysis) Receive cancer treatment or medicines that weaken their immune system MRSA infections can also occur in healthy people who have not recently been in the hospital. Most of these MRSA infections are on the skin, or less commonly, in the lung. People who may be at risk are: Athletes and others who share items such as towels or razors People who inject illegal drugs People who had surgery in the past year Children in day care Members of the military People who have gotten tattoos Recent influenza infection","It is normal for healthy people to have staph on their skin. Many of us do. Most of the time, it does not cause an infection or any symptoms. This is called ""colonization"" or ""being colonized."" Someone who is colonized with MRSA can spread it to other people. A sign of a staph skin infection is a red, swollen, and painful area on the skin. Pus or other fluids may drain from this area. It may look like a boil. These symptoms are more likely to occur if the skin has been cut or rubbed, because this gives the MRSA germ a way to enter your body. Symptoms are also more likely in areas where there is more body hair, because the germ can get into hair follicles. MRSA infection in people who are in health care facilities tends to be severe. These infections may be in the bloodstream, heart, lungs or other organs, urine, or in the area of a recent surgery. Some symptoms of these severe infections may include: Chest pain Cough or shortness of breath Fatigue Fever and chills General ill feeling Headache Rash Wounds that do not heal",,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA); Staph - MRSA; Staphylococcal - MRSA

Methylmercury causes central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage. How severe the damage is depends on how much poison gets into the body. Many of the symptoms of mercury poisoning are similar to symptoms of cerebral palsy. In fact, methylmercury is thought to cause a form of cerebral palsy. The FDA recommends that women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, and nursing mothers avoid fish that may contain unsafe levels of methylmercury. This includes swordfish, king mackerel, shark, and tilefish. Infants should not eat these fish, either. No one should eat any of these fish caught by friends and family. Check with your local or state health department for warnings against locally caught, noncommercial fish. Some health care providers have raised concerns about ethyl mercury (thiomersal), a chemical used in some vaccines.

A smaller than normal size is determined using standardized charts of head circumference.,"Microcephaly most often occurs because the brain does not grow at a normal rate. The growth of the skull is determined by brain growth. Brain growth takes place while a baby is in the womb and during infancy. Conditions that affect brain growth can cause smaller than normal head size. These include infections, genetic disorders, and severe malnutrition. Genetic conditions that cause microcephaly include: Cornelia de Lange syndrome Cri du chat syndrome Down syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome Seckel syndrome Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome Trisomy 18 Trisomy 21 Other problems that may lead to microcephaly include: Uncontrolled phenylketonuria (PKU) in the mother Methylmercury poisoning Congenital rubella Congenital toxoplasmosis Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) Use of certain drugs during pregnancy, especially alcohol and phenytoin Becoming infected with the Zika virus while pregnant can also cause microcephaly.

Migraine,"A migraine is a type of headache. It may occur with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. In most people, a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head.","A migraine headache is caused by abnormal brain activity. This activity can be triggered by many things. But the exact chain of events remains unclear. Most medical experts believe the attack begins in the brain and involves nerve pathways and chemicals. The changes affect blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues. Migraine headaches tend to first appear between the ages of 10 and 45. Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men. Some women, but not all, have fewer migraines when they are pregnant. Migraine attacks may be triggered by any of the following: Caffeine withdrawal Changes in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pills Changes in sleep patterns, such as not getting enough sleep Drinking alcohol Exercise or other physical stress Loud noises or bright lights Missed meals Odors or perfumes Smoking or exposure to smoke Stress and anxiety Migraines can also be triggered by certain foods. Most common are: Chocolate Dairy foods, especially certain cheeses Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG) Foods with tyramine, which includes red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans Fruits (avocado, banana, citrus fruit) Meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats) Onions Peanuts and other nuts and seeds Processed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods True migraine headaches are not a result of a brain tumor or other serious medical problem. Only your health care provider can determine if your symptoms are due to a migraine disorder or other condition.","There are two main types of migraines: Migraine with aura (classic migraine) Migraine without aura (common migraine) An aura is a group of nervous system (neurologic) symptoms. These symptoms are considered a warning sign that a migraine is coming. Most often, the vision is affected and can include any or all of the following: Temporary blind spots or colored spots Blurred vision Eye pain Seeing stars, zigzag lines, or flashing lights Tunnel vision (only able to see objects close to the center of the field of view) Other nervous system symptoms include yawning, difficulty concentrating, nausea, trouble finding the right words, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. Some of these symptoms are much less common with migraine headaches. If you have any of these symptoms, your provider will likely order tests to find the cause. An aura often occurs 10 to 15 minutes before the headache, but can occur just a few minutes to 24 hours before. A headache does not always follow an aura. The headaches usually: Start as a dull ache and get worse within minutes to hours Are throbbing, pounding, or pulsating Are worse on one side of the head with pain behind the eye or in the back of the head and neck Last 4 to 72 hours Other symptoms that may occur with the headache include: Chills Increased urination Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Sensitivity to light or sound Sweating Symptoms may linger, even after the migraine goes away. This is called a migraine hangover. Symptoms can include: Feeling mentally dull, like your thinking is not clear or sharp Needing more sleep Neck pain",,Headache - migraine; Vascular headache - migraine

If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.",
Milia,Milia are tiny white bumps or small cysts on the skin. They are almost always seen in newborn babies.,"Milia occur when dead skin becomes trapped in small pockets at the surface of the skin or mouth. They are common in newborn infants. Similar cysts are seen in the mouths of newborn infants. They are called Epstein pearls . These cysts also go away on their own. Adults may develop milia on the face. The bumps and cysts also occur on parts of the body that are swollen (inflamed) or injured. Rough sheets or clothing may irritate the skin and mild reddening around the bump. The middle of the bump will stay white. Irritated milia are sometimes called ""baby acne."" This is incorrect since milia are not a true from of acne.","Symptoms may include: Whitish, pearly bump in the skin of newborns Bumps that appear across the cheeks, nose, and chin Whitish, pearly bump on gums or roof of mouth (they may look like teeth coming through the gums)",,
Milk-alkali syndrome,"Milk-alkali syndrome is a condition in which there is a high level of calcium in the body (hypercalcemia). This causes a shift in the body's acid/base balance toward alkaline (metabolic alkalosis). As a result, there can be a loss of kidney function.","Milk-alkali syndrome is almost always caused by taking too many calcium supplements, usually in the form of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is a common calcium supplement. It is often taken to prevent or treat bone loss ( osteoporosis ). Calcium carbonate is also an ingredient found in antacids (such as Tums). A high level of vitamin D in the body, such as from taking supplements, can worsen milk-alkali syndrome. Calcium deposits in the kidneys and in other tissues can occur in milk-alkali syndrome.","In the beginning, the condition usually has no symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms do occur, they can include: Back, middle of the body, and low back pain in the kidney area (related to kidney stones) Confusion, strange behavior Constipation Depression Excessive urination Fatigue Irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) Nausea or vomiting Other symptoms that can result from kidney failure",,Calcium-alkali syndrome; Cope syndrome; Burnett syndrome; Hypercalcemia; Calcium metabolism disorder

If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move them to fresh air.",
Minimal change disease,"Minimal change disease is a kidney disorder that can lead to nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that include protein in the urine, low blood protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling.","Each kidney is made of more than a million units called nephrons, which filter blood and produce urine. In minimal change disease, there is damage to the glomeruli. These are the tiny blood vessels inside the nephron where blood is filtered to make urine and waste is removed. The disease gets its name because this damage is not visible under a regular microscope. It can only be seen under a very powerful microscope called an electron microscope. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It is also seen in adults with nephrotic syndrome, but is less common. The cause is unknown, but the disease may occur after or be related to: Allergic reactions Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Tumors Vaccinations (flu and pneumococcal, though rare) Viral infections","There may be symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, including: Foamy appearance of the urine Poor appetite Swelling (especially around the eyes, feet and ankles, and in the abdomen) Weight gain (from fluid retention) Minimal change disease does not reduce the amount of urine produced. It rarely progresses to kidney failure .",,Minimal change nephrotic syndrome; Nil disease; Lipoid nephrosis; Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood

Miscarriage,"A miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. Pregnancy losses after the 20th week are called stillbirths. Miscarriage is a naturally occurring event, unlike medication abortions or abortion procedures.","Most miscarriages are caused by chromosome problems that make it impossible for the fetus to develop. In rare cases, these problems are related to the mother's or father's genes. Other possible causes of miscarriage may include: Drug or alcohol use Blood clotting disorders Exposure to environmental toxins Hormone problems Infection Obesity Physical problems with the mother's reproductive organs Problem with the body's immune response Serious body-wide ( systemic ) diseases in the mother (such as uncontrolled diabetes ) Smoking Around half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost (aborted) spontaneously, usually before the woman knows she is pregnant. Among women who know they are pregnant, about 10% to 25% will have a miscarriage. Most miscarriages occur during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy. The rate of miscarriage drops after the fetus's heartbeat is detected. The risk for miscarriage is higher: In women who are older -- The risk increases after 30 years of age and becomes even greater between 35 and 40 years, and is highest after age 40. In women who have already had one or more miscarriages.","Possible symptoms of miscarriage may include: Low back pain or abdominal pain that is dull, sharp, or cramping Tissue or clot-like material that passes from the vagina Vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal cramps Some women may not have any symptoms at the beginning.",,Abortion - spontaneous; Spontaneous abortion; Abortion - missed; Abortion - incomplete; Abortion - complete; Abortion - inevitable; Abortion - infected; Missed abortion; Incomplete abortion; Complete abortion; Inevitable abortion; Infected abortion
Miscarriage - threatened,A threatened miscarriage is a condition that indicates the potential for a miscarriage or early pregnancy loss. It might take place before the 20th week of pregnancy.,"Some pregnant women have some vaginal bleeding during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Bleeding may occur with or without abdominal cramps. When the symptoms indicate a miscarriage is possible, the condition is called a ""threatened abortion."" (This refers to a natural event that is not due to a medical or surgical abortion.) Miscarriage is common. Small falls, injuries or stress during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause threatened miscarriage. It occurs in almost one half of all pregnancies. The chance of miscarriage is higher in older women. About one half of women who have bleeding in the first trimester will have a miscarriage.","Symptoms of a threatened miscarriage include: Vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (last menstrual period was less than 20 weeks ago). Vaginal bleeding occurs in almost all threatened miscarriages. Abdominal cramps may also occur. If abdominal cramps occur in the absence of significant bleeding, consult your health care provider to check for other problems besides threatened miscarriage. Note: During a miscarriage, low back pain or abdominal pain (dull to sharp, constant to intermittent) can occur. Tissue or clot-like material may pass from the vagina .",,Threatened miscarriage; Threatened spontaneous abortion; Abortion - threatened; Threatened abortion; Early pregnancy loss; Spontaneous abortion
Mistletoe poisoning,Mistletoe is an evergreen plant with white berries. Mistletoe poisoning occurs when someone eats any part of this plant. Poisoning can also occur if you drink tea created from the plant or its berries.,,"Symptoms of mistletoe poisoning can affect many parts of the body.

DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider,
Mitral stenosis,Mitral stenosis is a disorder in which the mitral valve does not fully open. This restricts the flow of blood.,"Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards. Mitral stenosis means that the valve cannot open enough. As a result, less blood flows to the body. The upper heart chamber swells as pressure builds up. Blood and fluid may then collect in the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), making it hard to breathe. In adults, mitral stenosis occurs most often in people who have had rheumatic fever. This is a disease that can develop after an illness with strep throat that was not properly treated. The valve problems develop 5 to 10 years or more after having rheumatic fever. Symptoms may not show up for even longer. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States because strep infections are most often treated. This has made mitral stenosis less common. Rarely, other factors can cause mitral stenosis in adults. These include: Calcium deposits forming around the mitral valve Radiation treatment to the chest Some medicines Children may be born with mitral stenosis (congenital) or other birth defects involving the heart that cause mitral stenosis. Often, there are other heart defects present along with the mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis may run in families.","Adults may have no symptoms. However, symptoms may appear or get worse with exercise or other activity that raises the heart rate. Symptoms will most often develop between ages 20 and 50. Symptoms may begin with an episode of atrial fibrillation (especially if it causes a fast heart rate). Symptoms may also be triggered by pregnancy or other stress on the body, such as infection in the heart or lungs, or other heart disorders. Symptoms may include: Chest discomfort that increases with activity and extends to the arm, neck, jaw or other areas (this is rare) Cough, possibly with bloody phlegm Difficulty breathing during or after exercise (This is the most common symptom.) Waking up due to breathing problems or when lying in a flat position Fatigue Frequent respiratory infections, such as bronchitis Feeling of pounding heart beat (palpitations) Swelling of feet or ankles In infants and children, symptoms may be present from birth (congenital). They will almost always develop within the first 2 years of life. Symptoms include: Cough Poor feeding, or sweating when feeding Poor growth Shortness of breath",,Mitral valve obstruction; Heart mitral stenosis; Valvular mitral stenosis
Mitral valve prolapse,"Mitral valve prolapse is a heart problem involving the mitral valve, which separates the upper and lower chambers of the left side of the heart. In this condition, the valve does not close normally.","The mitral valve helps blood on the left side of the heart flow in one direction. It closes to keep blood from moving backwards when the heart beats (contracts). Mitral valve prolapse is the term used when the valve does not close properly. It can be caused by many different things. In most cases, it is harmless. The problem generally does not affect health and most people with the condition are not aware of it. In a small number of cases, the prolapse can cause blood to leak backwards. This is called mitral regurgitation. Mitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders. Some forms of mitral valve prolapse seem to be passed down through families (inherited). Mitral valve prolapse is also seen with some connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and other rare genetic disorders. It is also sometimes seen in isolation in people who are otherwise normal.","Many people with mitral valve prolapse Do not have symptoms. A group of symptoms sometimes found in people with mitral valve prolapse has been called ""mitral valve prolapse syndrome,"" and includes: Chest pain (not caused by coronary artery disease or a heart attack) Dizziness Fatigue Panic attacks Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) Shortness of breath with activity or when lying flat (orthopnea) The exact relationship is between these symptoms and the valve problem is not clear. Some of the findings may be coincidental. When mitral regurgitation occurs, symptoms may be related to the leaking, particularly when severe.",,Barlow syndrome; Floppy mitral valve; Myxomatous mitral valve; Billowing mitral valve; Systolic click-murmur syndrome; Prolapsing mitral leaflet syndrome; Chest pain - mitral valve prolapse
Mitral valve regurgitation,Mitral regurgitation is a disorder in which the mitral valve on the left side of the heart does not close properly.,"Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards. When the mitral valve doesn't close all the way, blood flows backward into the upper heart chamber (atrium) from the lower chamber as it contracts. This is called mitral regurgitation and is a common type of heart valve disorder. This cuts down on the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder. This may lead to congestive heart failure. Mitral regurgitation may begin suddenly. This often occurs after a heart attack. When the regurgitation does not go away, it becomes long-term (chronic). Many other diseases or problems can weaken or damage the valve or the heart tissue around the valve. You are at risk for mitral valve regurgitation if you have: Coronary heart disease and high blood pressure Infection of the heart valves Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) Rare conditions, such as untreated syphilis or Marfan syndrome Rheumatic heart disease. This is a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common. Swelling of the left lower heart chamber Another important risk factor for mitral regurgitation is past use of a diet pill called ""Fen-Phen"" (fenfluramine and phentermine) or dexfenfluramine. The drug was removed from the market by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 because of safety concerns.","Symptoms may begin suddenly if: A heart attack damages the muscles around the mitral valve. The cords that attach the muscle to the valve break. An infection of the valve destroys part of the valve. There are often no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they often develop gradually, and may include: Cough Fatigue , exhaustion , and lightheadedness Rapid breathing Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) or a rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath that increases with activity and when lying down Waking up an hour or so after falling asleep because of trouble breathing Urination, excessive at night",,Mitral valve regurgitation; Mitral valve insufficiency; Heart mitral regurgitation; Valvular mitral regurgitation

Mittelschmerz,"Mittelschmerz is one-sided, lower abdominal pain that affects some women. It occurs at or around the time when an egg is released from the ovaries (ovulation).","One in five women have pain around the time of ovulation. This is called mittelschmerz. The pain may occur just before, during, or after ovulation. This pain can be explained in several ways. Just before the ovulation, the growth of the follicle where the egg develops may stretch the surface of the ovary. This can cause pain. At the time of ovulation, fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This may irritate the lining of the abdomen.","Mittelschmerz may be felt on one side of the body during one month and then switch to the other side during the next month. It may also occur on the same side for many months in a row. Symptoms include lower-abdominal pain that: Occurs only on one side. Goes on for minutes to a few hours. It can last up to 24 to 48 hours. Feels like a sharp, cramping pain unlike other pain. Is severe (rare). May switch sides from month to month. Begins midway through the menstrual cycle.",,Ovulation pain; Midcycle pain

Molluscum contagiosum,"Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection that causes raised, pearl-like papules or nodules on the skin.","Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus that is a member of the poxvirus family. You can get the infection in different ways. This is a common infection in children and occurs when a child comes into direct contact with a skin lesion or an object that has the virus on it. (A skin lesion is an abnormal area of skin.) The infection is most often seen on the face, neck, armpit, arms, and hands. However, it can occur anywhere on the body, except it is rarely seen on the palms and soles. The virus can spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as towels, clothing, or toys. The virus also spreads by sexual contact. Early lesions on the genitals may be mistaken for herpes or warts . Unlike herpes, these lesions are painless. People with a weakened immune system (due to conditions such as HIV/AIDS ) or severe eczema may have a rapidly spreading case of molluscum contagiosum.","The infection on the skin begins as a small, painless papule, or bump. It may become raised to a pearly, flesh-colored nodule. The papule often has a dimple in the center. Scratching or other irritation causes the virus to spread in a line or in groups, called crops. The papules are about 2 to 5 millimeters wide. Usually, there is no inflammation (swelling and redness) and no redness unless they have been irritated by rubbing or scratching. In adults, the lesions are commonly seen on the genitals, abdomen, and inner thigh.",,
Mononeuropathy,"Mononeuropathy is damage to a single nerve, which results in loss of movement, sensation, or other function of that nerve.","Mononeuropathy is a type of damage to a nerve outside the brain and spinal cord ( peripheral neuropathy ). Mononeuropathy is most often caused by injury. Diseases affecting the entire body ( systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage. Long-term pressure on a nerve due to swelling or injury can result in mononeuropathy. The covering of the nerve ( myelin sheath) or part of the nerve cell (the axon) may be damaged. This damage slows or prevents signals from traveling through the damaged nerves. Mononeuropathy may involve any part of the body. Some common forms of mononeuropathy include: Axillary nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the shoulder) Common peroneal nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in the foot and leg) Carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve dysfunction -- including numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers) Cranial mononeuropathy III, IV, compression or diabetic type Cranial mononeuropathy VI (double vision) Cranial mononeuropathy VII (facial paralysis) Femoral nerve dysfunction (loss of movement or sensation in part of the leg) Radial nerve dysfunction (problems with movement in the arm and wrist and with sensation in the back of the arm or hand) Sciatic nerve dysfunction (problem with the muscles of the back of the knee and lower leg, and sensation to the back of the thigh, part of the lower leg, and sole of the foot) Ulnar nerve dysfunction (cubital tunnel syndrome -- including numbness, tingling, weakness of outer and underside of arm, palm, ring and little fingers)","Symptoms depend on the specific nerve affected, and may include: Loss of sensation Paralysis Tingling , burning, pain, abnormal sensations Weakness",,Neuropathy; Isolated mononeuritis

Rarely, it is caused by other viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV).","Mono may begin slowly with fatigue, a general ill feeling, headache, and sore throat. The sore throat slowly gets worse. Your tonsils become swollen and develop a whitish-yellow covering. Often, the lymph nodes in the neck are swollen and painful. A pink, measles-like rash can occur, and is more likely if you take the medicine ampicillin or amoxicillin for a throat infection. (Antibiotics should typically not given without a test that shows you have a strep infection.) Common symptoms of mono include: Drowsiness Fever General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling Loss of appetite Muscle aches or stiffness Rash Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes , most often in the neck and armpit Less common symptoms are: Chest pain Cough Fatigue Headache Hives Jaundice (yellow color to the skin and whites of the eyes) Neck stiffness Nosebleed Rapid heart rate Sensitivity to light Shortness of breath",,Mono; Kissing disease; Glandular fever

Morning sickness,Morning sickness is nausea and vomiting that can occur at any time of the day during pregnancy.,"The exact cause of morning sickness is unknown. It may be caused by hormone changes or lower blood sugar during early pregnancy. Emotional stress, fatigue, traveling, or some foods can make the problem worse. Nausea in pregnancy is more common and can be worse with twins or triplets.",,"Try to keep a positive attitude. Remember that in most cases morning sickness stops after the first 3 or 4 months of pregnancy. To reduce nausea, try: A few soda crackers or dry toast when you first wake up, even before you get out of bed in the morning. A small snack at bedtime and when getting up to go to the bathroom at night. Avoid large meals; instead, snack as often as every 1 to 2 hours during the day and drink plenty of fluids. Eat foods high in protein and complex carbohydrates, such as peanut butter on apple slices or celery; nuts; cheese; crackers; milk; cottage cheese; and yogurt; avoid foods high in fat and salt, but low in nutrition. Ginger products (proven effective against morning sickness) such as ginger tea, ginger candy, and ginger soda. Here are some more tips: Acupressure wrist bands or acupuncture may help. You can find these bands in drug, health food, and travel and boating stores. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture, talk to your health care provider and look for an acupuncturist who is trained to work with pregnant women. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Avoid taking medicines for morning sickness. If you do, ask a provider first. Keep air flowing through rooms to reduce odors. When you feel nauseated, bland foods like gelatin, broth, ginger ale, and saltine crackers can soothe your stomach. Take your prenatal vitamins at night. Increase vitamin B6 in your diet by eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and peas and beans (legumes). Talk to your provider about possibly taking vitamin B6 supplements.

They sometimes last up to 6 weeks. The following steps can make you feel better: Avoid hot beverages and foods, spicy and salty foods, and citrus. Gargle with salt water or cool water. Eat fruit-flavored ice pops. This is helpful if you have a mouth burn. Take pain relievers such as acetaminophen. For canker sores: Apply a thin paste of baking soda and water to the sore. Mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 1 part water and apply this mixture to the sores using a cotton swab. For more severe cases, treatments include fluocinonide gel (Lidex), dexamethasone mouthwash, anti-inflammatory amlexanox paste (Aphthasol), or chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex) mouthwash. Over-the-counter medicines, such as Orabase, can protect a sore inside the lip and on the gums. Blistex or Campho-Phenique may provide some relief of canker sores and fever blisters, especially if applied when the sore first appears. To help cold sores or fever blisters, you can also apply ice to the sore. Acyclovir cream 5% can also be used to help reduce the duration of a cold sore. To help cold sores or fever blisters, you can also apply ice to the sore. You may reduce your chance of getting common mouth sores by: Avoiding very hot foods or beverages Reducing stress and practicing relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation Chewing slowly Using a soft-bristle toothbrush Visiting your dentist right away if you have a sharp or broken tooth or poorly fitting dentures If you seem to get canker sores often, talk to your provider about taking folate and vitamin B12 to prevent outbreaks.

Mpox,"Mpox is a viral infection in which a person develops fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and a rash that may affect the entire body. Most cases resolve within 2 to 4 weeks.","Mpox was first detected in Denmark in 1958 in a colony of monkeys used for research. This is how it first came to be called ""monkeypox."" The name was changed to mpox to reduce the stigma associated with the previous name. The first human case of mpox occurred in 1970 in the DRC. In 2022, mpox spread to countries where mpox does not normally occur. This included countries in Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, and Australia. Mpox is caused by Orthopoxvirus . It is similar to the virus that causes smallpox. There are two types of mpox virus: clade I and clade II. Clade I is endemic to Central Africa (including the DRC). Endemic means it is always present in some members of the population. Clade I is more severe and causes serious illness and death. It has killed as many as 10% of those infected. Recent death rates have been lower. Currently, there are no cases of Clade I mpox outside of central and eastern Africa. Clade II is endemic to West Africa. It is the type of mpox that caused the 2022 global outbreak. This type of mpox is much less severe, with nearly all people recovering from the illness. Clade II mpox is still spreading in small clusters in urban areas in the United States, but at much lower numbers than in 2022. Both types of the Mpox virus are transmitted in the same way. Mpox can spread when a person comes into close contact with an infected animal, human, or material contaminated with the virus. Mpox can be transmitted from animal to human when a person: Comes in contact with an infected animal Gets bitten or scratched by an infected animal Handles or consumes bushmeat People with mpox can spread the virus to animals, such as pets and livestock. Mpox can be transmitted from human to human through close contact , such as: Direct skin-to-skin contact with body fluids, sores, rash, or scabs from an infected person Touching objects, clothing, linens, or surfaces used by a person with mpox Exposure to large respiratory droplets Mpox can be transmitted from human to human during intimate contact , including: Oral, anal, and vaginal sex Touching the genitals or anus of an infected person Hugging, kissing, cuddling, and massaging Face-to-face contact Touching fabrics or objects during sex that were used by a person with mpox such as bedding, towels, and sex toys A pregnant person can spread the virus to their fetus through the placenta.","Symptoms usually appear in 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the virus. A rash appears that can be found on or near the genitals and can appear on all parts of the body. The rash starts as flat spots that become raised bumps, which fill with fluid, then pus. The bumps may be painful. Soon they crust over and form itchy scabs that fall off and heal over. Flu-like symptoms include: Fever Chills Swollen lymph nodes Muscle aches Backache Headache Fatigue Sore throat , runny nose , or cough You may experience all or just some of the symptoms. You may have flu-like symptoms followed by the rash in 1 to 4 days You may get the rash first, then the flu-like symptoms Or you may just have a rash Some people can spread the virus anywhere from 1 to 4 days before having any symptoms. Mpox illness lasts about 2 to 4 weeks. You are no longer contagious only after: All symptoms are gone Scabs have healed completely New skin has formed",,Poxvirus; Orthopoxvirus; Monkeypox

MSG symptom complex,"MSG symptom complex is a set of symptoms associated with eating food with the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is the sodium salt of a common amino acid, glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in our bodies and in many foods including cheese and tomatoes. MSG is added to many different types of foods as a flavor enhancer.","Reports of reactions to MSG originated in 1968 in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since then, reports of reactions to MSG have come from people claiming to experience symptoms after consuming food containing MSG. However, studies on MSG in foods have failed to find a conclusive link between MSG and the symptoms some people describe. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did a study of the issue and found no evidence that MSG in food caused symptoms. The report did find minor reactions in people who consumed 3 or more grams of MSG alone without food. Most foods with MSG have less than 0.5 grams of the additive. MSG is rated as ""generally considered safe"" by the FDA.","Symptoms, if they occur, are usually mild and go away in a short time: Flushing Headache Muscle aches Numbness or burning in or around the mouth Heart palpitations Tingling Drowsiness",,Hot dog headache; Glutamate-induced asthma; MSG (monosodium glutamate) syndrome; Chinese restaurant syndrome; Kwok's syndrome

As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.","MPS I is inherited, which means that your parents typically pass the disease on to you. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. People with MPS I do not make an enzyme called lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase. This enzyme helps break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These molecules are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints. Without the enzyme, glycosaminoglycans build up and damage organs, including the heart. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. The mild form is called attenuated MPS I and the severe form is called severe MPS I.","Symptoms of MPS I most often appear from ages 3 to 8 years. Children with severe MPS I develop symptoms earlier than those with the less severe form.

As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.","MPS II is a genetic disorder. This means it can be passed down through families. The affected gene is on the X chromosome. Boys are most often affected because they inherit the X chromosome from their mothers. Their mothers do not have symptoms of the disease, but they carry a nonworking copy of the gene. MPS II is caused by a lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Without this enzyme, chains of sugar molecules build up in various body tissues, causing damage. The early-onset, severe form of the disease begins shortly after age 2. A late-onset, mild form causes less severe symptoms to appear later in life.","In the early-onset, severe form, symptoms include: Aggressive behavior Hyperactivity Mental function gets worse over time Severe intellectual disability Jerky body movements In the late (mild) form, there can be mild to no mental deficiency.

As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.","MPS III is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait. MPS III occurs when the enzymes needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective. There are four main types of MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected. Type A is caused by a defect in the SGSH gene and is the most severe form. People with this type do not have a normal form of the enzyme called heparan N -sulfatase. Type B is caused by a defect in the NAGLU gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough alpha- N -acetylglucosaminidase. Type C is caused by a defect in the HGSNAT gene.

Multifocal atrial tachycardia,Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rapid heart rate. It occurs when too many signals (electrical impulses) are sent from the upper heart (atria) to the lower heart (ventricles).,"The human heart gives off electrical impulses, or signals, which tell it to beat. Normally, these signals begin in an area of the upper right chamber called the sinoatrial node (sinus node or SA node). This node is considered the heart's ""natural pacemaker."" It helps control the heartbeat. When the heart detects a signal, it contracts (or beats). The normal heart rate in adults is 60 to 100 beats per minute. The normal heart rate is faster in children. In MAT, many locations in the atria fire signals at the same time. Too many signals lead to a rapid heart rate. It most often ranges from 100 to 130 beats per minute or more in adults. The rapid heart rate may cause the heart to work too hard and not move blood efficiently. If the heartbeat is very fast, there is less time for the heart chamber to fill with blood between beats. Therefore, not enough blood is pumped to the brain and the rest of the body with each contraction. MAT is most common in people age 50 and over. It is often seen in people with conditions that lower the amount of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Heart failure (also called congestive heart failure) Lung cancer Lung failure Pneumonia Pulmonary embolism You may be at higher risk for MAT if you have: Coronary heart disease Diabetes Had surgery within the last 6 weeks Overdosed on the drug theophylline Sepsis When the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the arrhythmia is called ""wandering atrial pacemaker.""","Some people may have no symptoms.

Multiple sclerosis,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).,"MS affects women more often than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, but it can be seen at any age. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. It is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that it is caused by a virus, a gene defect, or both. Environmental factors may also play a role. You are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common (areas further from the equator).","Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different.

Multiple system atrophy - cerebellar subtype,"Multiple system atrophy - cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) is a rare disease that causes areas deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord, to shrink (atrophy). MSA-C used to be known as olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA).",MSA-C can be passed down through families (inherited form). It can also affect people without a known family history (sporadic form). Researchers have identified certain genes that are involved in the inherited form of this condition. The cause of MSA-C in people with the sporadic form is not known. The disease slowly gets worse (is progressive). MSA-C is slightly more common in men than in women. The average age of onset is 54 years.,"Symptoms of MSA-C tend to start at a younger age in people with the inherited form. The main symptom is clumsiness ( ataxia ) that slowly gets worse. There may also be problems with balance, slurring of speech, and difficulty walking. Other symptoms may include: Abnormal eye movements Abnormal movements Abnormal sweating Bowel or bladder problems Difficulty swallowing Cold hands and feet Lightheadedness when standing Headache while standing that is relieved by lying down Muscle stiffness or rigidity, spasms, tremor Nerve damage (neuropathy) Problems in speaking and sleeping due to spasms of the vocal cords Sexual function problems",,MSA-C; Cerebellar multiple system atrophy; Olivopontocerebellar atrophy; OPCA; Olivopontocerebellar degeneration
Multiple system atrophy - parkinsonian type,"Multiple system atrophy- parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is a rare condition that causes symptoms similar to Parkinson disease. However, people with MSA-P have more widespread damage to the part of the nervous system that controls important functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating.","The cause of MSA-P is unknown. The affected areas of the brain overlap with areas affected by Parkinson disease, with similar symptoms. For this reason, this subtype of MSA is called parkinsonian. MSA-P is most often diagnosed in men older than 60.","MSA damages the nervous system. The disease tends to progress rapidly. About one half of people with MSA-P have lost most of their motor skills within 5 years of onset of the disease. Symptoms may include: Tremors Movement difficulties, such as slowness, loss of balance, shuffling when walking Frequent falls Muscle aches and pains (myalgia), and stiffness Face changes, such as a masklike appearance to the face and staring Difficulty chewing or swallowing (occasionally), not able to close the mouth Disrupted sleep patterns (often during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep late at night) Dizziness or fainting when standing up or after standing still Erection problems Loss of control over bowels or bladder Problems with activity that requires small movements (loss of fine motor skills), such as writing that is small and hard to read Loss of sweating in any part of the body Decline in mental function Nausea and problems with digestion Posture problems, such as unstable, stooped, or slumped over Vision changes , decreased or blurred vision Voice and speech changes Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Confusion Dementia Depression Sleep-related breathing difficulties, including sleep apnea or a blockage in the air passage that leads to a harsh vibrating sound Restless legs",,Shy-Drager syndrome; Neurologic orthostatic hypotension; Shy-McGee-Drager syndrome; Parkinson plus syndrome; MSA-P; MSA-C
Multiple vitamin overdose,Multiple vitamin overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of multivitamin supplements. This can be by accident or on purpose.,,"Iron overdose may include vomiting, diarrhea (which may be bloody or dark), or weakness. People with severe overdoses may develop coma, low blood pressure, liver failure, lung injury, and death. Calcium overdose can impair the functioning of the kidneys, increase the pH of the blood, and can cause nausea and vomiting, confusion or changes in thinking or mentation, itching, and in extreme cases irregular heartbeat. Vitamin D overdose can contribute to high levels of calcium in the blood. Vitamin A overdose can cause nausea and vomiting, dizziness, blurry vision. Additional symptoms of a multivitamin overdose in different parts of the body may include: BLADDER AND KIDNEYS Cloudy urine Frequent urination Increased urine amount EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, AND THROAT Dry, cracking lips (from chronic overdose) Eye irritation Increased sensitivity of the eyes to light HEART AND BLOOD Irregular heartbeat Rapid heartbeat MUSCLES AND JOINTS Bone pain Joint pain Muscle pain Muscle weakness NERVOUS SYSTEM Confusion, mood changes Convulsions (seizures) Fainting Fatigue Headache Mental changes Irritability SKIN AND HAIR Flushing (reddened skin) from niacin (vitamin B3) Dry, cracking skin Itching , burning skin, or rash Yellow-orange areas of skin Sensitivity to sun (more likely to sunburn) Hair loss (from long-term overdose) STOMACH AND INTESTINES Intestinal bleeding (from iron) Appetite loss Constipation (from iron or calcium) Diarrhea, possibly bloody Nausea and vomiting Stomach pain Weight loss (from long-term overdose)",Seek medical help right away.

Mumps,"Mumps is a contagious disease that leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands. The salivary glands produce saliva, a liquid that moistens food and helps you chew and swallow.","Mumps is caused by a virus. The virus spreads from person to person by drops of moisture from the nose and mouth, such as through sneezing. It is also spread through direct contact with items that have infected saliva on them. Mumps most often occurs in children ages 2 through 12 who have not been vaccinated against the disease. However, the infection can occur at any age and may also be seen in college age students. The time between being exposed to the virus and getting sick (incubation period) is about 12 to 25 days. Mumps may also infect the: Central nervous system Pancreas Testes","Symptoms of mumps may include: Face pain Fever Headache Sore throat Loss of appetite Swelling of the parotid glands (the largest salivary glands, located between the ear and the jaw) Swelling of the temples or jaw (temporomandibular area) Other symptoms that can occur in males are: Testicle lump Testicle pain Scrotal swelling",,Epidemic parotitis; Viral parotitis; Parotitis
Munchausen syndrome by proxy,"Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a mental illness and a form of child abuse. The caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick.","No one is sure what causes Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Sometimes, the person was abused as a child or has Munchausen syndrome (fake illness for themselves).","The caretaker can do extreme things to fake symptoms of illness in the child. For example, the caretaker may: Add blood to the child's urine or stool Withhold food so the child looks like they can't gain weight Heat up thermometers so it looks like the child has a fever Make up lab results Give the child drugs to make the child throw up or have diarrhea Infect an intravenous (IV) line to make the child sick What are the signs in a caretaker? Most people with this problem are mothers with small children. Some are adult children taking care of an older parent. The caretakers often work in health care and know a lot about medical care. They can describe the child's symptoms in great medical detail. They like to be very involved with the health care team and are liked by the staff for the care they give the child. These caretakers are very involved with their children. They seem devoted to the child. This makes it hard for health professionals to see a diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. What are the signs in a child? The child sees a lot of health care providers and has been in the hospital a lot. The child often has had many tests, surgeries, or other procedures. The child has strange symptoms that don't fit with any disease. The symptoms do not match the test results. The child's symptoms are reported by the caretaker. They are never seen by health care professionals. The symptoms are gone in the hospital, but start again when the child goes home. Blood samples do not match the child's blood type. Drugs or chemicals are found in the child's urine, blood, or stool.",,Factitious disorder by proxy; Child abuse - Munchausen
Muscle aches,"Muscle aches and pains are common and can involve more than one muscle. Muscle pain also can involve ligaments, tendons, and fascia. Fascias are the soft tissues that connect muscles, bones, and organs.","The most common causes of muscle aches and pains are: Injury or trauma, including sprains and strains Overuse including using a muscle too much, too soon before warming up, or too often Tension or stress Muscle pain may also be due to: Certain drugs, including ACE inhibitors for lowering blood pressure, cocaine, and statins for lowering cholesterol Dermatomyositis Electrolyte imbalance, such as too little potassium or calcium Fibromyalgia Infections, including the flu, Lyme disease , malaria , muscle abscess , polio , Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and trichinosis Lupus Polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyositis Rhabdomyolysis",,"For muscle pain from overuse or injury, rest the affected body part and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Apply ice for the first 24 to 72 hours after injury to reduce pain and inflammation. After that, heat often feels more soothing. Muscle aches from overuse and fibromyalgia often respond well to massage. Gentle stretching exercises after a long rest period are also helpful. Regular exercise can help restore proper muscle tone. Walking, cycling, and swimming are good aerobic activities to try. A physical therapist or athletic trainer can teach you stretching, toning, and aerobic exercises to help you feel better and stay pain-free. Begin slowly and increase workouts gradually. Avoid high-impact aerobic activities and weight lifting when injured or while in pain. Be sure to get plenty of sleep and try to reduce stress. Yoga and meditation are excellent ways to help you sleep and relax. If home measures aren't working, your health care provider may prescribe medicine or physical therapy. You may need to be seen at a specialized pain clinic. If your muscle aches are due to a specific disease, do the things your provider has told you to treat the underlying condition. These steps may help lower the risk for getting muscle aches: Stretch before and after exercising. Warm up before exercising and cool down afterward. Drink lots of fluids before, during, and after exercise. If you work in the same position most of the day (such as sitting at a computer), stretch at least every hour.",Muscle pain; Myalgia; Pain - muscles
Muscle atrophy,Muscle atrophy is the wasting (thinning) or loss of muscle tissue.,"There are three types of muscle atrophy: physiologic, pathologic, and neurogenic. Physiologic atrophy is caused by not using the muscles enough. This type of atrophy can often be reversed with exercise and better nutrition. People who are most affected are those who: Have seated jobs, health problems that limit movement, or decreased activity levels Are bedridden Cannot move their limbs because of stroke or other brain disease Are in a place that lacks gravity, such as during space flights Pathologic atrophy is seen with aging, starvation, and diseases such as Cushing disease (because of taking too much medicines called corticosteroids or having overactive adrenal glands). Neurogenic atrophy is the most severe type of muscle atrophy. It can be from an injury to, or disease of a nerve that connects to the muscle. This type of muscle atrophy tends to occur more suddenly than physiologic atrophy. Examples of diseases affecting the nerves that control muscles: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease) Damage to a single nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome Guillain-Barré syndrome Nerve damage caused by injury, diabetes, toxins, or alcohol Polio ( poliomyelitis ) Spinal cord injury Although people can adapt to muscle atrophy, even minor muscle atrophy causes some loss of movement or strength. Other causes of muscle atrophy may include: Burns Long-term corticosteroid therapy Malnutrition Muscular dystrophy and other diseases of the muscle Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis",,"An exercise program may help treat muscle atrophy. Exercises may include ones done in a swimming pool to reduce the muscle workload, and other types of rehabilitation. Your health care provider can tell you more about this. People who cannot actively move one or more joints can do exercises using braces or splints .",Muscle wasting; Wasting; Atrophy of the muscles

Muscle cramps,"Muscle cramps are when a muscle gets tight (contracts) without you trying to tighten it, and it does not relax. Cramps may involve all or part of one or more muscles.","Muscle cramps are common and often occur when a muscle is overused or injured. Working out when you have not had enough fluids (dehydration) or when you have low levels of minerals such as sodium, potassium, or calcium can also make you more likely to have a muscle spasm. Muscle cramps can occur while you play tennis or golf, bowl, swim, or do any other exercise. They can also be triggered by: Alcoholism Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) Kidney failure Medicines Menstruation Pregnancy",,"If you have a muscle cramp, stop your activity and try stretching and massaging the muscle. Heat will relax the muscle when the spasm begins, but ice may be helpful when the pain has improved. If the muscle is still sore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines can help with pain. If the muscle cramps are severe, your health care provider can prescribe other medicines. The most common cause of muscle cramps during sports activity is not getting enough fluids. Often, drinking water will ease the cramping. However, water alone does not always help. Salt tablets or sports drinks, which also replenish lost minerals, can be helpful. Other tips for relieving muscle cramps: Change your workouts so that you are exercising within your ability. Drink plenty of fluids while exercising and increase your potassium intake (orange juice and bananas are great sources of potassium). Stretch to improve flexibility.",Cramps - muscle
Muscle disorder,"A muscle disorder causes patterns of weakness, loss of muscle tissue, electromyogram (EMG) findings, or biopsy results that suggest a muscle problem. The muscle disorder can be inherited, such as muscular dystrophy, or acquired, such as alcoholic or steroid myopathy.",,The main symptom is weakness. Other symptoms include cramps and stiffness.,,Myopathic changes; Myopathy; Muscle problem
Muscle function loss,Muscle function loss is when a muscle does not work or move normally. The medical term for complete loss of muscle function is paralysis.,"Diseases of the muscles that cause muscle-function loss include: Alcohol-associated myopathy Congenital myopathies (most often due to a genetic disorder) Dermatomyositis and polymyositis Drug-induced myopathy (statins, steroids) Muscular dystrophy Diseases of the nervous system that cause muscle function loss include: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease) Bell palsy Botulism Guillain-Barré syndrome Myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton Syndrome Neuropathy Paralytic shellfish poisoning Periodic paralysis Focal nerve injury Polio or other viruses Spinal cord or brain injury Stroke",,"Sudden loss of muscle function is a medical emergency. Get medical help right away. After you have received medical treatment, your health care provider may recommend some of the following measures: Follow your prescribed therapy. If the nerves to your face or head are damaged, you may have difficulty chewing and swallowing or closing your eyes. In these cases, a soft diet may be recommended. You will also need some form of eye protection, such as a patch over the eye while you are asleep. Long-term immobility can cause serious complications. Change positions often and take care of your skin. Range-of-motion exercises may help to maintain some muscle tone. Splints may help prevent muscle contractures, a condition in which a muscle becomes permanently shortened.",Paralysis; Paresis; Loss of movement; Motor dysfunction

Muscle twitching,Muscle twitches are fine movements of a small area of muscle.,"Causes may include: Autoimmune disorders , such as Isaac syndrome. Drug overdose (caffeine, amphetamines, or other stimulants). Lack of sleep. Medicine side effect (such as from diuretics, corticosteroids, or estrogens). Exercise (twitching is seen after exercise). Lack of nutrients in the diet (deficiency). Stress. Medical conditions that cause metabolic disorders, including low potassium, kidney disease, and uremia. Twitches not caused by disease or disorders (benign twitches), often affecting the eyelids, calf, or thumb. These twitches are normal and quite common, and are often triggered by stress or anxiety . These twitches can come and go, and usually do not last for more than a few days. Nervous system conditions that can cause muscle twitching include: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), also sometimes called Lou Gehrig disease or motor neuron disease Neuropathy or damage to the nerve that leads to a muscle Spinal muscular atrophy Weak muscles (myopathy) Symptoms of a nervous system disorder include: Loss of, or change in, sensation Loss of muscle size (wasting) Weakness",,"No treatment is needed for benign muscle twitching in most cases. In other cases, treating an underlying medical cause may improve symptoms.",Muscle fasciculation; Fasciculations of muscle
Muscular dystrophy,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue, which get worse over time.",Inherited conditions are passed down through families. They may become manifest in childhood or adulthood. There are many different types of MD. They include: Becker muscular dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy Myotonic muscular dystrophy,"MD can affect adults, but the more severe forms tend to occur in early childhood. Symptoms vary among the different types of MD. All of the muscles may be affected. Or, only specific groups of muscles may be affected, such as those around the pelvis, shoulder, or face. The muscle weakness slowly gets worse and symptoms may include: Delayed development of muscle motor skills Difficulty using one or more muscle groups Drooling Eyelid drooping (ptosis) Frequent falls Loss of strength in a muscle or group of muscles as an adult Loss in muscle size Problems walking (delayed walking) Muscle contractures Intellectual disability is present in some types of MD.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with this illness are not able to do their usual activities. Sometimes, they may be confined to bed. The condition can also be called systemic exertional intolerance disease (SEID).","The exact cause of ME/CFS is unknown. It may have more than one cause. For example, two or more possible causes may work together to trigger the illness. Researchers are looking into these possible causes: Infection -- About 1 out of 10 people who develop certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever, go on to develop ME/CFS. Other infections have also been studied, but not one cause has been found. Immune system changes -- ME/CFS may be triggered by changes in the way a person's immune system responds to stress or illness. Mental or physical stress -- Many people with ME/CFS have been under serious mental or physical stress before becoming ill. Energy production -- The way that cells within the body get energy is different in people with ME/CFS than in people without the condition. It's unclear how this is linked to developing the illness. Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC) -- Some people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus continue to have symptoms weeks or months later. This is called long COVID . Because symptoms such as extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and sleep problems are similar to ME/CFS, researchers are looking into a possible connection between the two conditions. Genetics or environmental factors may also play a role in the development of ME/CFS: Anyone can get ME/CFS. While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. White people are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, particularly among minorities.","There are three main, or ""core,"" symptoms in people with ME/CFS: Profound fatigue Worsening symptoms after physical or mental activity Sleep problems People with ME/CFS have persistent and profound fatigue and are unable to do activities they were able to do before the illness. This extreme fatigue is: New Lasts at least 6 months Not due to unusual or intense activity Not relieved by sleep or bed rest Severe enough to keep you from participating in certain activities ME/CFS symptoms can become worse after physical or mental activity. This is called post-exertional malaise (PEM), also known as a crash, relapse, or collapse. For example, you may experience a crash after shopping at the grocery store and need to take a nap before driving home. Or you may need someone to come pick you up. There is no way to predict what will cause a crash or know how long it will take to recover. It can take days, weeks, or longer to recover. Sleep issues may include problems falling or staying asleep. A full-night's rest does not relieve fatigue and other symptoms. People with ME/CFS also often experience at least one of the two following symptoms: Forgetfulness, concentration problems, problems following details (also called ""brain fog"") Worsening symptoms when standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. You may feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when standing or sitting up. You also may have vision changes or see spots. Other common symptoms include: Joint pain without swelling or redness, muscle aches, muscle weakness all over, or headaches that differ from those you have had in the past Sore throat, sore lymph nodes in the neck or under the arms, chills and night sweats Digestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome Allergies Sensitivity to noise, food, odors, or chemicals",,CFS; Fatigue - chronic; Immune dysfunction syndrome; Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME); Myalgic encephalopathy chronic fatigue syndrome (ME-CFS); Systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID)
Myasthenia gravis,Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them.,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder . An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue to be a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (conveyed by neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. In some cases, myasthenia gravis is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system). Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men.","Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest. This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including: Double vision and drooping eyelids (ptosis) are the most common first symptoms Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position Difficulty talking Drooping head Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles Fatigue Hoarseness or changing voice Difficulty maintaining steady gaze",,Neuromuscular disorder - myasthenia gravis

Myelodysplastic syndrome,Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of disorders in which the blood cells produced in the bone marrow do not mature into healthy cells. This leaves you with fewer healthy blood cells in your body. The blood cells that have matured may not function properly.,"Stem cells in bone marrow form different types of blood cells. With MDS, the DNA in stem cells becomes damaged. Because the DNA is damaged, the stem cells cannot produce healthy blood cells. The exact cause of MDS is not known. For most cases, there is no known cause. Risk factors for MDS include: Certain genetic disorders Exposure to environmental or industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, solvents, or heavy metals Smoking Prior cancer treatment increases the risk for MDS. This is called secondary or treatment-related MDS. Certain chemotherapy medicines increase the chance of developing MDS. This is a major risk factor. Radiation therapy, when used with chemotherapy, increases the risk for MDS even more. People who have stem cell transplants may develop MDS because they also receive high doses of chemotherapy. MDS usually occurs in adults age 60 years and older. It is more common in men. Watch this video about: Red blood cell production","Early stage MDS often has no symptoms. MDS is often discovered during other blood tests. People with very low blood counts often experience symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of blood cell affected, and they include: Weakness or tiredness due to anemia Shortness of breath Easy bruising and bleeding Small red or purple pinpoint dots under the skin caused by bleeding Frequent infections and fever",,Myeloid malignancy; Myelodysplastic syndrome; MDS; Preleukemia; Smoldering leukemia; Refractory anemia; Refractory cytopenia
Myelofibrosis,Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.,"Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of: Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues) White blood cells (which fight infection) Platelets (which help your blood clot) When the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells. Anemia , bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur. As a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell. The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews. Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome , leukemia , and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Abdominal fullness , pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because of an enlarged spleen) Bone pain Easy bleeding, bruising Fatigue Increased likelihood of getting an infection Pale skin Shortness of breath with exercise Weight loss Night sweats Low grade fever Enlarged liver Dry cough Itchy skin",,Idiopathic myelofibrosis; Myeloid metaplasia; Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; Primary myelofibrosis; Secondary myelofibrosis; Bone marrow - myelofibrosis
Myelomeningocele,Myelomeningocele is a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close fully before birth.,"During the first month of a pregnancy, the two sides of the baby's spine (or backbone) usually join together to cover the spinal cord, spinal nerves, and meninges (the tissues covering the spinal cord). The developing brain and spine at this point are called the neural tube. The term ""NTD"" refers to any birth defect in which the neural tube in the area of the spine fails to close completely. Myelomeningocele is an NTD in which the bones of the spine do not completely form. This results in an incomplete spinal canal. The spinal cord and meninges protrude from the child's back. This condition may affect as many as 1 out of every 4,000 infants. Other types of NTDs include: Spina bifida occulta, a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close. The spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect. Meningoceles, a condition where the meninges protrude from the spinal defect. The spinal cord remains in place. Encephaloceles, a condition where the meninges and even brain can protrude from the skull. A child with myelomeningocele may also have other disorders or birth defects. Eight out of ten children with this condition have hydrocephalus , or an abnormal buildup of spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain. Other disorders of the spinal cord or musculoskeletal system may be seen with myelomeningocele, including: Syringomyelia (a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord) Hip dislocation The cause of NTDs is not known. However, low levels of folic acid in a woman's body before and during early pregnancy appear to play a part in this type of birth defect. Folic acid (or folate) is important for development of brain and spinal cord. If a child is born with myelomeningocele, future children in that family have a higher risk than the general population. However, in many cases, there is no family connection. Factors such as diabetes, obesity, and the use of anti-seizure and other medicines known to lower folic acid levels in the mother may increase the risk of this defect.","A newborn with this disorder will have an open area or a fluid-filled sac on the mid to lower back. Symptoms may include: Loss of bladder or bowel control Partial or complete lack of sensation Partial or complete paralysis of the legs Weakness of the hips, legs, or feet of a newborn Other signs and/or symptoms may include: Abnormal feet or legs, such as clubfoot Buildup of fluid inside the skull ( hydrocephalus )",,Meningomyelocele; Spina bifida; Cleft spine; Neural tube defect (NTD); Birth defect - myelomeningocele

Symptoms can include: Pain in the front of the ribs or breastbone Feeling that your heart is racing Lightheadedness Nausea or vomiting Shortness of breath Weakness,,Blunt myocardial injury
Myocarditis,Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle.,"Myocarditis is an uncommon disorder. Most of the time, it is caused by an infection that reaches the heart. When you have an infection, your immune system produces special cells to fight off disease. If the infection affects your heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. However, the chemicals made by these cells can also damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak. Many cases are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19 ), influenza (flu) virus, coxsackievirus, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus , adenovirus, and others. It may also be caused by bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, streptococcus, mycoplasma, and chlamydia . Other causes of myocarditis include: Reactions to certain medicines, such as certain chemotherapy medicines Exposure to chemicals in the environment, such as heavy metals Infections due to fungus or parasites Radiation Autoimmune disorders that cause inflammation throughout the body Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare Sometimes the exact cause may not be discovered.","There may be no symptoms. Symptoms may be similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may include: Chest pain that may resemble a heart attack Fatigue or listlessness Fever and other signs of infection including headache, muscle aches, sore throat, diarrhea, or rashes Joint pain or swelling Leg swelling Pale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation) Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Other symptoms that may occur with this disease include: Fainting , often related to irregular heart rhythms Low urine output",,Inflammation - heart muscle
Myocarditis - pediatric,Pediatric myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle in an infant or young child.,"Myocarditis is rare in young children. It is slightly more common in older children and adults. It is often worse in newborns and young infants than in children over age 2. Most cases in children are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include: Influenza (flu) virus Coxsackie virus Parovirus Adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) It may also be caused by bacterial infections such as Lyme disease . Other causes of pediatric myocarditis include: Allergic reactions to certain medicines Exposure to chemicals in the environment Infections due to fungus or parasites Radiation Some diseases (autoimmune disorders) that cause inflammation throughout the body Some drugs Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare. The heart muscle may be directly damaged by the virus or the bacteria that infect it. The body's immune response can also damage the heart muscle (called the myocardium) in the process of fighting the infection. This can lead to symptoms of heart failure.","Symptoms may be mild at first and hard to detect. Sometimes in newborns and infants, symptoms may appear suddenly. Symptoms may include: Anxiety Failure to thrive or poor weight gain Feeding difficulties Fever and other symptoms of infection Listlessness Low urine output (a sign of decreasing kidney function) Pale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation) Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Symptoms in children over age 2 may also include: Belly area pain and nausea Chest pain Cough Fatigue Shortness of breath Swelling (edema) in the legs, feet, and face",,

Myotonia congenita,"Myotonia congenita is an inherited condition that affects muscle relaxation. It is congenital, meaning that it is present from birth. It occurs more frequently in northern Scandinavia.","Myotonia congenita is caused by a genetic change (genetic variant). It is passed down from either one or both parents to their children (inherited). Myotonia congenita is caused by a problem in the part of the muscle cells that are needed for muscles to relax. Abnormal repeated electrical signals occur in the muscles, causing a type of muscle stiffness called myotonia.","The hallmark of this condition is myotonia. This means the muscles are unable to quickly relax after contracting. For example, after a handshake, the person is only very slowly able to open and pull away their hand. Early symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing Gagging Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated Shortness of breath or tightening of the chest at the beginning of exercise Frequent falls Difficulty opening eyes after forcing them closed or crying Children with myotonia congenita often look muscular and well-developed. They may not have symptoms of myotonia congenita until age 2 or 3.",,Thomsen's disease; Becker's disease

Nabothian cyst,A nabothian cyst is a lump filled with mucus on the surface of the cervix or cervical canal.,"The cervix is lined with glands and cells that release mucus. The glands can become covered by a type of skin cells called squamous epithelium. When this happens, the secretions build up in the plugged glands. They form a smooth, rounded bump on the cervix . The bump is called a nabothian cyst.","Each nabothian cyst appears as a small, white raised bump. There can be more than one.",,
Nail abnormalities,"Nail abnormalities are problems with the color, shape, texture, or thickness of the fingernails or toenails.","Injury: Crushing the base of the nail or the nail bed may cause a permanent deformity. Chronic picking or rubbing of the skin behind the nail can cause median nail dystrophy, which gives a lengthwise split or ridged appearance of the thumbnails. Long-term exposure to moisture or nail polish can cause nails to peel and become brittle. Infection: Fungus or yeast cause changes in the color, texture, and shape of the nails. Bacterial infection may cause a change in nail color or painful areas of infection under the nail or in the surrounding skin. Severe infections may cause nail loss. Paronychia is an infection around the nailfold and cuticle. Viral warts may cause a change in the shape of the nail or ingrown skin under the nail. Certain infections (especially of the heart valve) may cause red streaks in the nail bed ( splinter hemorrhages ). Diseases: Disorders that affect the amount of oxygen in the blood (such as heart problems and lung diseases including cancer or infection) may cause clubbing . Kidney disease can cause a build-up of nitrogen waste products in the blood, which can damage nails. Liver disease can damage nails. Thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may cause brittle nails or splitting of the nail bed from the nail plate (onycholysis). Severe illness or surgery may cause horizontal depressions in the nails called Beau lines. Psoriasis may cause pitting, splitting of the nail plate from the nail bed, and chronic (long-term) destruction of the nail plate (nail dystrophy). Other conditions that can affect the appearance of the nails include systemic amyloidosis , malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, and lichen planus . Skin cancers near the nail and fingertip can distort the nail. Subungual melanoma is a potentially deadly cancer that will normally appear as a dark streak down the length of the nail. Hutchinson sign is a darkening of the cuticle associated with a pigmented streak and may be a sign of an aggressive melanoma . Poisons: Arsenic poisoning may cause white lines and horizontal ridges. Silver intake can cause a blue nail. Medicines: Certain antibiotics can cause lifting of the nail from the nail bed. Chemotherapy medicines can affect nail growth. Normal aging affects the growth and development of the nails.",,"To prevent nail problems: DO NOT bite, pick, or tear at your nails (in severe cases, some people may need counseling or encouragement to stop these behaviors). Keep hangnails clipped. Wear shoes that do not squeeze the toes together, and always cut toenails straight across along the top. To prevent brittle nails, keep the nails short and do not use nail polish. Use an emollient (skin softening) cream after washing or bathing. Bring your own manicure tools to nail salons and DO NOT allow the manicurist to work on your cuticles. Using the vitamin biotin in high doses (5,000 micrograms daily) and clear nail polish that contains protein can help strengthen your nails.

Narcolepsy,Narcolepsy is a nervous system problem that causes extreme sleepiness and attacks of daytime sleep.,"Experts aren't sure of the exact cause of narcolepsy. It may have more than one cause. Many people with narcolepsy have a low level of hypocretin (also known as orexin). This is a chemical made in the brain that helps you stay awake. In some people with narcolepsy, there are fewer of the cells that make this chemical. This may be due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's healthy tissue. Narcolepsy can run in families. Researchers have found certain genes linked to narcolepsy.","Narcolepsy symptoms usually first occur between age 15 and 30 years. Below are the most common symptoms. EXTREME DAYTIME SLEEPINESS You may feel a strong urge to sleep, often followed by a period of sleep. You can't control when you fall asleep. This is called a sleep attack. These periods can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. They may happen after eating, while talking to someone, or during other situations. Most often, you wake up feeling refreshed. Attacks can occur while you are driving or doing other activities where falling asleep can be dangerous. CATAPLEXY During these attacks, you can't control your muscles and can't move. Strong emotions, such as laughter or anger, can trigger cataplexy. Attacks often last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. You remain aware during the attack. During the attack, your head falls forward, your jaw drops, and your knees may buckle. In severe cases, you may fall and stay paralyzed for as long as several minutes. HALLUCINATIONS You see or hear things that aren't there, either as you fall asleep or when you wake up. During hallucinations , you may feel afraid or under attack. SLEEP PARALYSIS This is when you can't move your body as you start falling asleep or when you first wake up. It may last up to 15 minutes. Most people with narcolepsy have daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Not everyone has all these symptoms. Surprisingly, despite being very tired, many people with narcolepsy don't sleep well at night. There are two main types of narcolepsy: Type 1 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and a low level of hypocretin. Type 2 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, but no cataplexy, and a normal level of hypocretin.",,Daytime sleep disorder; Cataplexy

Nearsightedness,Nearsightedness is when light entering the eye is focused incorrectly. This makes distant objects appear blurred. Nearsightedness is a type of refractive error of the eye.,"People are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye. Nearsightedness occurs when there is a mismatch between the focusing power of the eye and the length of the eye. Light rays are focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. As a result, what you see is blurry. Most of the eye's focusing power comes from the cornea. Watch this video about: Seeing Nearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy. However, a small number of people with severe nearsightedness develop a form of retinal degeneration. The predominant wavelength of light in your environment may affect the development of myopia. Recent research suggests that more time outdoors during childhood may lead to less myopia.","A nearsighted person sees close-up objects clearly, but objects in the distance are blurred. Squinting will tend to make far away objects seem clearer. Nearsightedness is often first noticed in school-aged children or teenagers. Children often cannot read the blackboard, but they can easily read a book. Nearsightedness gets worse during the growth years. People who are nearsighted may need to change glasses or contact lenses often. Nearsightedness most often stops progressing as a person stops growing in his or her early twenties. Other symptoms may include: Eyestrain Headaches (uncommon)",,Myopia; Shortsightedness; Refractive error - nearsightedness

Neck pain,"Neck pain is discomfort in any of the structures in the neck. These include the muscles, nerves, bones (vertebrae), joints, and the discs between the bones.","A common cause of neck pain is muscle strain or tension. Most often, everyday activities are to blame. Such activities include: Bending over a desk for a long time (often an hour or more) Having poor posture while watching TV or reading Having your computer monitor positioned too high or too low Sleeping in an uncomfortable position Twisting and turning your neck in a jarring manner while exercising Lifting things too quickly or with poor posture Accidents or falls can cause severe neck injuries, such as vertebral fractures, whiplash, blood vessel injury, and even paralysis.

You will need to learn: How to relieve the pain What your activity level should be What medicines you can take For minor, common causes of neck pain: Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Apply heat or ice to the painful area. Use ice for the first 48 to 72 hours, and then use heat after that. Apply heat with warm showers, warm compresses, or a heating pad. To prevent injury to your skin, DO NOT fall asleep with a heating pad or ice bag in place. Stop normal physical activity for the first few days. This helps calm your symptoms and reduce inflammation. Do slow range-of-motion exercises, up and down, side to side, and from ear to ear. This helps gently stretch the neck muscles. Have a partner gently massage the sore or painful areas. Try sleeping on a firm mattress with a pillow that supports your neck. You may want to get a special neck pillow. Ask your health care provider about using a soft neck collar to relieve discomfort. However, using collar for a long time can weaken neck muscles. Take it off from time to time to allow the muscles to get stronger.",Pain - neck; Neck stiffness; Cervicalgia; Whiplash; Stiff neck

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum,"Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an uncommon skin condition related to diabetes. It results in reddish brown areas of the skin, most commonly on the lower legs.",The cause of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is unknown. It is thought to be linked to blood vessel inflammation related to autoimmune factors . This damages proteins in the skin (collagen). People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to get NLD than those with type 2 diabetes. Women are more affected than men. Smoking increases the risk for NLD. Less than one half of one percent of those with diabetes suffer from this problem.,"A skin lesion is an area of skin that is different from the skin around it. With NLD, skin lesions start as firm, smooth, red bumps (papules) on the shins and lower part of the legs. They usually appear in the same areas on opposite sides of the body. They are painless in the early stage. As the papules become bigger, they flatten. They develop a shiny yellow brown center with raised red to purplish edges. Veins are visible below the yellow part of the lesions. The lesions are irregularly round or oval with well-defined borders. They can spread and join together to give the appearance of a patch. Lesions can also occur on the forearms. Rarely, they may occur on the stomach, face, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet. Trauma may cause the lesions to develop ulcers . Nodules also may develop. The area may become very itchy and painful. NLD is different from ulcers that can occur on the feet or ankles in people with diabetes.",,Necrobiosis lipoidica; NLD; Diabetes - necrobiosis

Necrotizing enterocolitis,Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the death of tissue in the intestine. It occurs most often in premature or sick babies.,"NEC occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or premature. It is likely to occur while the infant is still in the hospital. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown. A drop in blood flow to the bowel can damage the tissue. Bacteria in the intestine may also add to the problem. Also, premature infants have an undeveloped immune response to factors such as bacteria or low blood flow. An imbalance in immune regulation appears to be involved in NEC. Babies at higher risk for the condition include: Premature infants Infants who are fed formula rather than human milk. (Human milk contains growth factors, antibodies and immune cells which may help prevent the problem.) Infants in a nursery where an outbreak has occurred Infants who have received blood exchange transfusions or have been seriously ill","Symptoms may come on slowly or suddenly, and may include: Abdominal bloating Blood in the stool Diarrhea Feeding problems Lack of energy Unstable body temperature Unstable breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure Vomiting",,

Necrotizing soft tissue infection,"Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare but very severe type of bacterial infection. It can destroy the muscles, skin, and underlying tissue. The word ""necrotizing"" refers to something that causes body tissue to die.","Many different types of bacteria can cause this infection. A very severe and usually deadly form of necrotizing soft tissue infection is due to the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes , which is sometimes called ""flesh-eating bacteria"" or strep. Necrotizing soft tissue infection develops when the bacteria enters the body, usually through a minor cut or scrape. The bacteria begin to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. With flesh-eating strep, the bacteria also make chemicals that block the body's ability to respond to the organism. As the tissue dies, the bacteria enters the blood and rapidly spreads throughout the body.","Symptoms may include: A small, red, painful lump or bump on the skin that spreads A very painful bruise-like area then develops and grows rapidly, sometimes in less than an hour The center becomes dark and dusky and then turns black and the tissue dies The skin may break open and ooze fluid Other symptoms may include: Feeling ill Fever Sweating Chills Nausea Dizziness Weakness Shock",,Necrotizing fasciitis; Fasciitis - necrotizing; Flesh-eating bacteria; Soft tissue gangrene; Gangrene - soft tissue
Necrotizing vasculitis,Necrotizing vasculitis is a group of disorders that involve inflammation of the blood vessel walls. The size of the affected blood vessels helps to determine the names of these conditions and how the disorder causes disease.,"Necrotizing vasculitis may be the primary condition such as in people with polyarteritis nodosa or granulomatosis with ANCA associated vasculitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis). In other cases, the vasculitis may occur as part of another disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or hepatitis C. The cause of the inflammation is unknown. It is likely related to autoimmune factors. The wall of the blood vessel may scar and thicken or die (become necrotic ). The blood vessel may close, interrupting blood flow to the tissues it supplies. The lack of blood flow will cause the tissues to die. Sometimes the blood vessel may break and bleed (rupture). Necrotizing vasculitis may affect blood vessels in any part of the body. Therefore, it can cause problems in the skin, brain, lungs, intestines, kidney, brain, joints or any other organ.","Fever, chills, fatigue, arthritis, or weight loss may be the only symptoms at first. However, symptoms may be in almost any part of the body.

Neonatal abstinence syndrome,Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a group of problems that can happen when a baby is exposed to opioid drugs or medicine for a length of time while in their mother's womb (uterus).,"NAS may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, or medicines such as codeine, oxycodone (Oxycontin), methadone, or buprenorphine. These and other substances pass through the placenta that connects the baby to its mother in the womb. The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother. If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system. Withdrawal symptoms also may occur in babies exposed to alcohol , benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs) while in the womb. Babies of mothers who use opioids and other addictive drugs (nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol) may have long-term problems. While there is no clear evidence of a NAS for other drugs, they may contribute to the severity of a baby's NAS symptoms.","The symptoms of NAS depend on: The type of drug the mother used How the body breaks down and clears the drug (influenced by genetic factors) How much of the drug she was taking How long she used the drug Whether the baby was born full-term or early (premature) Symptoms often begin within 1 to 3 days after birth, but may take up to a week to appear. Because of this, the baby will most often need to stay in the hospital for observation and monitoring for up to a week. Symptoms may include: Blotchy skin coloring (mottling) Diarrhea Excessive crying or high-pitched crying Excessive sucking Fever Hyperactive reflexes Increased muscle tone Irritability Poor feeding Rapid breathing Seizures Sleep problems Slow weight gain Stuffy nose, sneezing Sweating Trembling (tremors) Vomiting",,NAS; Neonatal abstinence symptoms; NOWS; Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome
Neonatal conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis is swelling or infection of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye.,"Swollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by: A blocked tear duct Eye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth Infection by bacteria or viruses Bacteria that normally live in a woman's vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by: Gonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact. The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia. The mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem.","Infected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth.

Neonatal hypothyroidism,"Neonatal hypothyroidism is decreased thyroid hormone production in a newborn. In very rare cases, no thyroid hormone is produced. The condition is also called congenital hypothyroidism. Congenital means present from birth.","The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system . It is located at the front of the neck, just above where the collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism . Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by: A missing or poorly developed thyroid gland A pituitary gland that does not stimulate the thyroid gland Thyroid hormones that are poorly formed or do not work Medicines the mother took during pregnancy Lack of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy Antibodies made by the mother's body that block the baby's thyroid function A thyroid gland that is not fully developed is the most common defect. Girls are affected twice as often as boys.","Most affected infants have few or no symptoms. This is because their thyroid hormone level is only slightly low. Infants with severe hypothyroidism often have a unique appearance, including: Dull look Puffy face Thick tongue that sticks out This appearance often develops as the disease gets worse. The child may also have: Poor feeding, choking episodes Constipation Dry, brittle hair Hoarse cry Jaundice (skin and whites of the eyes look yellow) Lack of muscle tone ( floppy infant) Low hairline Short height Sleepiness Sluggishness",,Cretinism; Congenital hypothyroidism
Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome,Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a problem often seen in premature babies. The condition makes it hard for the baby to breathe.,"Neonatal RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed. The disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery substance in the lungs called surfactant. This substance helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating. Surfactant is present when the lungs are fully developed. Neonatal RDS can also be due to genetic problems with lung development. Most cases of RDS occur in babies born before 37 to 39 weeks. The more premature the baby is, the higher the chance of RDS after birth. The problem is uncommon in babies born full-term or later (39 weeks or after). Other factors that can increase the risk for RDS include: A brother or sister who had RDS Diabetes in the mother Cesarean delivery or induction of labor before the baby is full-term Problems with delivery that reduce blood flow to the baby Multiple pregnancy (twins or more) Rapid labor","Most of the time, symptoms appear within minutes of birth. However, they may not be seen for several hours.

Late onset sepsis occurs after 1 week through 3 months of age.,"Neonatal sepsis can be caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli ( E coli ), Listeria , and some strains of streptococcus. Group B streptococcus (GBS) has been a major cause of neonatal sepsis. However, this problem has become less common because women are screened for GBS during pregnancy. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) can also cause a severe infection in a newborn baby. This happens most often when the mother is newly infected with HSV. Early-onset neonatal sepsis most often appears within 24 to 48 hours of birth. The baby gets the infection from the mother before or during delivery. The following increase an infant's risk of early-onset bacterial sepsis: GBS colonization during pregnancy Preterm delivery Water breaking (rupture of membranes) longer than 18 hours before birth Infection of the placenta tissues and amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis) Babies with late-onset neonatal sepsis are infected after delivery. The following increase an infant's risk for sepsis after delivery: Having a catheter in a blood vessel for a long time Staying in the hospital for an extended period of time",Infants with neonatal sepsis may have the following symptoms: Body temperature changes Breathing problems Diarrhea or decreased bowel movements Low blood sugar Reduced movements Reduced sucking Seizures Slow or fast heart rate Swollen belly area Vomiting Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice),,Sepsis neonatorum; Neonatal septicemia; Sepsis - infant

Nephrocalcinosis,Nephrocalcinosis is a disorder in which there is too much calcium deposited in the kidneys. It is common in premature babies.,"Any disorder that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine may lead to nephrocalcinosis. In this disorder, calcium deposits in the kidney tissue itself. Most of the time, both kidneys are affected. Nephrocalcinosis is related to, but not the same as, kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Conditions that can cause nephrocalcinosis include: Alport syndrome Bartter syndrome Chronic glomerulonephritis Familial hypomagnesemia Medullary sponge kidney Primary hyperoxaluria Renal transplant rejection Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) Renal cortical necrosis Other possible causes of nephrocalcinosis include: Ethylene glycol toxicity Hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) due to hyperparathyroidism or other medical conditions Hypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine) Use of certain medicines, such as acetazolamide, amphotericin B, and triamterene Sarcoidosis Tuberculosis of the kidney and infections related to AIDS Vitamin D toxicity","Most of the time, there are no early symptoms of nephrocalcinosis beyond those of the condition causing the problem. People who also have kidney stones may have: Blood in the urine Fever and chills Nausea and vomiting Severe pain in the belly area, sides of the back (flank), groin, or testicles Later symptoms related to nephrocalcinosis may be associated with long-term (chronic) kidney failure .",,
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a disorder in which a defect in the small tubes (tubules) in the kidneys causes a person to pass a large amount of urine and lose too much water.,"Normally, the kidney tubules allow most water in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood. NDI occurs when the kidney tubules do not respond to a hormone in the body called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin. ADH normally causes the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated. As a result of not responding to the ADH signal, the kidneys release too much water into the urine. This causes the body to produce a large quantity of very dilute urine. NDI is very rare. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus means it is present at birth. It is a result of a genetic variant passed down through families. Men are usually affected, though women can pass this gene on to their children. Most commonly, NDI develops because of other reasons. This is called an acquired disorder. Factors that can trigger the acquired form of this condition include: Blockage in the urinary tract High blood calcium levels Low blood potassium levels Use of certain medicines (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin B)","You may have intense or uncontrollable thirst, and crave ice water. You will produce large amounts of urine, usually more than 3 liters, and up to 15 liters per day. The urine is very dilute and looks almost like water. You may need to urinate every hour or even more, even during the night when you are not eating or drinking as much. If you do not drink enough fluids, dehydration can result. Symptoms may include: Dry mucous membranes Dry skin Sunken appearance to eyes Sunken fontanelles (soft spot) in infants Changes in memory or balance Other symptoms that can occur due to lack of fluids, causing dehydration, include: Fatigue, feeling weak Headache Irritability Low body temperature Muscle pain Rapid heart rate Weight loss A change in alertness, and even coma",,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; Acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; NDI
Nephrotic syndrome,"Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms and abnormal test results that include protein in the urine, low blood protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, increased blood clot risk, and swelling.","Nephrotic syndrome is caused by different disorders that damage the kidneys. This damage leads to the release of too much protein in the urine. The most common cause in children is minimal change disease . Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common cause in adults. In both diseases, the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged. Glomeruli are the structures that help filter wastes and fluids. This condition can also occur due to: Cancer Diseases such as diabetes , systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple myeloma , and amyloidosis Genetic disorders Immune disorders Infections (such as strep throat , hepatitis , or mononucleosis ) Use of certain drugs It can occur with kidney disorders such as: Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis Glomerulonephritis Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis Nephrotic syndrome can affect all age groups. In children, it is most common between ages 2 and 6. This disorder occurs slightly more often in males than females.","Swelling (edema) is the most common symptom. It may occur: In the face and around the eyes ( facial swelling ) In the arms and legs, especially in the feet and ankles In the belly area ( swollen abdomen ) Other symptoms include: Skin rash or sores Foamy appearance of the urine Poor appetite Weight gain (unintentional) from fluid retention Seizures",,Nephrosis

Neuralgia,"Neuralgia is a sharp, shocking pain that follows the path of a nerve and is due to irritation or damage to the nerve.","Causes of neuralgia include: Chemical irritation Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Infections, such as herpes zoster ( shingles ), HIV/AIDS , Lyme disease , and syphilis Chemotherapy medicines such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, or vincristine Porphyria (blood disorder) Pressure on nerves by nearby bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or tumors Trauma (including surgery) Underlying nervous system disorder (such as multiple sclerosis ) In many cases, the cause is unknown. Postherpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia are the two most common forms of neuralgia. A related but less common neuralgia affects the glossopharyngeal nerve , which provides feeling to the throat. Neuralgia is more common in older people, but it may occur at any age.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Increased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as pain Pain along the path of the nerve that is sharp or stabbing, in the same location each episode, comes and goes (intermittent) or is constant and burning, and may get worse when the area is moved Weakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve",,Nerve pain; Painful neuropathy; Neuropathic pain
Neuroblastoma,Neuroblastoma is a very rare type of cancerous tumor that develops from nerve tissue. It usually occurs in infants and children.,"Neuroblastoma can occur in many areas of the body. It develops from the tissues that form the sympathetic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system that controls body functions, such as heart rate and blood pressure, digestion, and levels of certain hormones. Most neuroblastomas begin in the abdomen, in the adrenal gland, next to the spinal cord, or in the chest. Neuroblastomas can spread to the bones. Bones include those in the face, skull, pelvis, shoulders, arms, and legs. It can also spread to the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and around the eyes (orbits). The cause of the tumor is not known. Experts believe that a defect in a gene may play a role. Half of tumors are present at birth. Neuroblastoma is most commonly diagnosed in children before the age of 5. Each year there are around 700 new cases in the United States. The disorder is slightly more common in boys. In most people, the tumor has spread when it is first diagnosed.","The first symptoms are usually fever, a general sick feeling ( malaise ), and pain. There may also be loss of appetite, weight loss, and diarrhea. Other symptoms depend on the site of the tumor, and may include: Bone pain or tenderness (if the cancer has spread to the bones) Difficulty breathing or a chronic cough (if the cancer has spread to the chest) Enlarged abdomen (from a large tumor or excess fluid) Flushed, red skin Pale skin and bluish color around the eyes Profuse sweating Rapid heart rate ( tachycardia ) Brain and nervous system problems may include: Inability to empty the bladder Loss of movement ( paralysis ) of the hips, legs, or feet (lower extremities) Problems with balance Uncontrolled eye movements or leg and feet movements (called opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, or ""dancing eyes and dancing feet"")",,Cancer - neuroblastoma
Neurocognitive disorder,Neurocognitive disorder is a general term that describes decreased mental function due to a medical disease other than a psychiatric illness.,"Listed below are conditions associated with neurocognitive disorder. BRAIN INJURY CAUSED BY TRAUMA Bleeding into the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage) Bleeding into the space around the brain ( subarachnoid hemorrhage ) Blood clot inside the skull but outside the brain and its covering, which may cause pressure on the brain ( subdural hematoma or epidural hematoma ) Concussion BREATHING CONDITIONS Low oxygen in the body (hypoxia) High carbon dioxide level in the body (hypercapnia) CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Dementia due to many strokes ( multi-infarct dementia ) Heart infections ( endocarditis , myocarditis ) Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS Alzheimer disease (also called senile dementia, Alzheimer type) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Diffuse Lewy body disease Huntington disease Normal pressure hydrocephalus Parkinson disease Pick disease AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Multiple sclerosis Autoimmune encephalitis DEMENTIA DUE TO METABOLIC CAUSES Kidney disease Liver disease Thyroid disease ( hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism ) Vitamin deficiency (B1, B12, or folate) DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED CONDITIONS Alcohol withdrawal state Intoxication from drug or alcohol use Medicine effect, such as corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, and antidepressants Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , a long-term effect of deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) Withdrawal from medicines, such as sedative-hypnotics and corticosteroids INFECTIONS Any sudden onset ( acute ) or long-term ( chronic ) infection Blood poisoning ( septicemia ) Brain infection ( encephalitis ) Meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) Prion infections, such as mad cow disease Late-stage syphilis Complications of cancer and cancer treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the brain can also lead to neurocognitive disorder.

In general, neurocognitive disorder causes: Agitation Confusion Long-term loss of brain function (mild cognitive impairment or dementia) Severe, short-term loss of brain function (delirium)",,Organic mental disorder (OMS); Organic brain syndrome
Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA),"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) are a group of very rare nervous system disorders. They are passed down through families (inherited). NBIA involves movement problems, dementia, and other nervous system symptoms.",Symptoms of NBIA begin in childhood or adulthood. There are 10 types of NBIA. Each type is caused by a different gene defect. The most common gene defect causes the disorder called PKAN (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration). People with all forms of NBIA have a buildup of iron in the basal ganglia. This is an area deep inside the brain. It helps control movement.,"NBIA mainly causes movement problems. Other symptoms may include: Dementia Difficulty speaking Difficulty swallowing Muscle problems such as rigidity or involuntary muscle contractions ( dystonia ) Seizures Tremor Vision loss, such as from retinitis pigmentosa Weakness Writhing movements Toe walking",,Hallervorden-Spatz disease; Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration; PKAN; NBIA
Neurofibromatosis 2,Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a disorder in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (the central nervous system). It may be passed down (inherited) in families.,"NF2 is caused by a change in the gene NF2. NF2 can be passed down through families in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that if one parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it. Some cases of NF2 occur when the gene mutates on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.","Symptoms of NF2 include: Balance problems Cataracts at a young age Changes in vision Coffee-colored marks on the skin (café-au-lait), less common Headaches Hearing loss Ringing and noises in the ears Weakness of the face",,NF2; Bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis; Bilateral vestibular schwannomas; Central neurofibromatosis
Neurofibromatosis-1,Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is an inherited disorder in which nerve tissue tumors (neurofibromas) form in the:,"NF1 is a genetic disease. If either parent has NF1, each of their children has a 50% chance of having the disease. NF1 also appears in families with no history of the condition. In these cases, it is caused by a new gene change (variant or mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is caused by problems with a gene for a protein called neurofibromin.","NF1 causes tissue along the nerves to grow uncontrollably. This growth can put pressure on affected nerves. If the growths are in the skin, there can be cosmetic issues. If the growths are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects. Problems with feeling or movement can occur, depending on which nerves are affected. The condition can be very different from person to person, even among people in the same family who have the same NF1 gene change. ""Coffee-with-milk"" ( café au lait ) spots are the hallmark symptom of NF1. Many healthy people have one or two small café au lait spots. However, adults who have six or more spots that are bigger than 1.5 cm in diameter (0.5 cm in children) could have NF1. In some people with the condition, these spots may be the only symptom. Other symptoms may include: Tumors of the eye, such as optic glioma Seizures Freckles in the underarm or groin Large, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin Pain (from affected nerves) Small, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromas",,NF1; Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis
Neurogenic bladder,"Neurogenic bladder is a problem in which a person lacks bladder control due to a brain, spinal cord, or nerve condition.","Several muscles and nerves must work together for the bladder to hold urine until you are ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax at the right time. Disorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder. These can include: Alzheimer disease Birth defects of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida Brain or spinal cord tumors Cerebral palsy Encephalitis Learning disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Multiple sclerosis (MS) Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Stroke Damage or disorders of the nerves that supply the bladder can also cause this condition. These can include: Nerve damage (neuropathy) Nerve damage due to long-term, heavy alcohol use Nerve damage due to long-term diabetes Nerve damage due to vitamin B12 deficiency Nerve damage from syphilis Nerve damage due to pelvic surgery Nerve damage from a herniated disk or spinal canal stenosis",The symptoms depend on the cause. They often include symptoms of urinary incontinence . Symptoms of overactive bladder may include: Having to urinate too often but in small amounts Problems emptying all the urine from the bladder Loss of bladder control Symptoms of underactive bladder may include: Full bladder and possibly urine leakage Inability to tell when the bladder is full Problems starting to urinate or emptying all the urine from the bladder (urinary retention),,Neurogenic detrusor overactivity; NDO; Neurogenic bladder sphincter dysfunction; NBSD
Neurologic deficit,"A neurologic deficit refers to abnormal neurologic function of a body area. This altered function is due to injury of the brain, spinal cord, muscles, or nerves that feed the affected area.",,,,
Neuromyelitis optica,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a disorder of the central nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. NMO causes inflammation and damage to the optic nerve and spinal cord. The optic nerve sends signals from the back of the eye (retina) to the brain. In some cases, NMO also may affect the brain.","NMO is a type of autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are conditions where the body’s immune system destroys healthy cells and tissues. NMO causes damage to a type of nerve cell called astrocytes as well as the myelin sheath of nerve cells. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. This can occur anywhere along the optic nerve and spinal cord. NMO is often confused with and misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) because they have similar symptoms. However, the two conditions are different and have different treatments. There is no identifiable cause for NMO. The disease tends to develop in childhood or in a person's 40s. It may occur after an infection. People with a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders may also be at risk. There are two main types of NMO: Relapsing NMO is the most common form. It has flare-ups that occur between periods of recovery. Women are more likely to get this form of NMO. Monophasic NMO is much less common and affects men and women equally. It involves a single attack that may last for 1 to 2 months and does not recur.","NMO may cause different symptoms that range in severity. One main symptom is inflammation of one or both optic nerves ( optic neuritis ). Optic nerves transmit images from the eyes to the brain. Swelling and inflammation of the optic nerve may cause eye problems such as: Eye pain Blurred vision Partial vision loss Blindness in one or both eyes Other symptoms include: Inflammation of the spinal cord ( myelitis ) Pain around the chest and waist Unexplained hiccups Persistent nausea or vomiting Uncontrollable itching Difficulty in swallowing ( dysphagia ) Respiratory disorders Problems with movement and coordination (motor or sensory dysfunction) Inability to hold stool or urine ( bowel or bladder incontinence ) Brain damage (encephalopathy) Double vision Sleep disorders such as disturbed sleep, decreased sleep quality, or restless legs syndrome Sexual dysfunction Recurrent attacks of visual, motor, and sensory dysfunction Weakness, numbness, or paralysis of the arms and legs",,NMO; NMOD; Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; Devic disease; Optic neuritis; Demyelinating disorder; Transverse myelitis
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL),Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) refers to a group of rare disorders of the nerve cells. NCL is passed down through families (inherited).,NCL involves the buildup of an abnormal material called lipofuscin in the brain. NCL is thought to be caused by problems with the brain's ability to remove and recycle proteins. Lipofuscinoses are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. This means each parent passes on a nonworking copy of the gene for the child to develop the condition. Only one adult subtype of NCL is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.,Symptoms of NCL include: Abnormally increased muscle tone or spasm Blindness or vision problems Dementia Lack of muscle coordination Intellectual disability Movement disorder Loss of speech Seizures Unsteady walk,,Lipofuscinoses; Batten disease; Jansky-Bielschowsky; Kufs disease; Spielmeyer-Vogt; Haltia-Santavuori disease; Hagberg-Santavuori disease
Neuropathy secondary to drugs,"Neuropathy is injury to one or more peripheral nerves. These are nerves that are not in the brain or spinal cord. Neuropathy secondary to drugs causes a loss of sensation or movement in a part of the body due to nerve damage from taking a certain medicine, combination of medicines, or illicit (street) drugs.","The damage is caused by the toxic effect of certain medicines or illicit (street) drugs on the peripheral nerves. There may be damage to the axon part of the nerve cell, which interferes with nerve signals. Or, the damage may involve the myelin sheath, which insulates the axons and increases the speed of transmission of signals through the axon. Most commonly, many nerves are involved (polyneuropathy). This usually causes sensation changes that begin in the outside parts of the body ( distal ) and move toward the center of the body ( proximal ). There may also be changes in movement, such as weakness. There may also be burning pain. Many medicines and substances may lead to development of neuropathy. Examples are listed below. Heart or blood pressure drugs: Amiodarone Hydralazine Perhexiline Drugs used to fight cancer (chemotherapy drugs): Cisplatin Docetaxel Paclitaxel Suramin Vincristine Drugs used to fight infections: Chloroquine Dapsone Isoniazid (INH), used against tuberculosis Metronidazole (Flagyl) Nitrofurantoin Thalidomide (used to fight leprosy ) Drugs used to treat autoimmune disease : Etanercept (Enbrel) Infliximab (Remicade) Leflunomide (Arava) Tacrolimus Drugs used to treat seizures: Carbamazepine Phenytoin Phenobarbital Anti-alcohol drugs: Disulfiram Drugs to fight HIV/AIDS: Didanosine (Videx) Emtricitabine (Emtriva) Stavudine (Zerit) Tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada) Other drugs and substances that may cause neuropathy include: Colchicine (used to treat gout) Excess pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) Arsenic Gold Illicit drugs (such as methaqualone) Glue sniffing n-Hexane Nitrous oxide (laughing gas)","Symptoms may include any of the following: Numbness , loss of sensation Tingling, abnormal sensations Weakness Burning pain Loss of balance Trouble walking Sensation changes usually begin in the feet or hands and move inward.",,
Neuroretinitis,"Neuroretinitis is inflammation of the retina and optic nerve of the eye. The condition can be caused by bacteria, viruses or autoimmune disease. It shares some features of optic neuritis. There is mostly central visual loss, which often recovers after some months, but often not completely.",,,,
Neurosarcoidosis,"Neurosarcoidosis is a form of sarcoidosis, in which inflammation occurs in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the nervous system.","Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body, mostly the lungs. In a small number of people, the disease involves some part of the nervous system. This is called neurosarcoidosis. Neurosarcoidosis may affect any part of the nervous system. Sudden facial weakness ( facial palsy or facial droop) is a common neurological symptom that involves the nerves to the muscles of the face. Any other nerve in the skull can be affected, including those in the eye and those that control taste, smell, or hearing. The spinal cord is another part of the nervous system that sarcoidosis can affect. People may have weakness in their arms and legs, and difficulty walking or controlling their urine or bowels. In some cases, the spinal cord is so severely affected that both legs are paralyzed. The condition can also affect the parts of the brain involved in regulating many bodily functions, such as temperature, sleep, and stress responses. Other areas of the brain, including the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, can be affected. Involvement of muscles or peripheral nerves can cause weakness and sensory loss.","The symptoms vary. Any part of the nervous system can be affected. Involvement of the brain or cranial nerves can cause: Confusion , disorientation Decreased hearing Dementia Dizziness , vertigo , or abnormal sensations of movement Double vision or other vision problems, including blindness Facial palsy (weakness, drooping) Headache Loss of sense of smell Loss of sense of taste , abnormal tastes Mental disturbances Seizures Speech impairment Involvement of the pituitary gland can cause: Changes in menstrual periods Excessive tiredness or fatigue Excessive thirst High urine output Weight changes Hair changes Involvement of one or more peripheral nerves can lead to: Abnormal sensations in any body part Loss of movement of any body part Loss of sensation in any body part Weakness of any body part",,Sarcoidosis - nervous system

Neurosyphilis,Neurosyphilis is a bacterial infection of the brain or spinal cord. It usually occurs in people who have had untreated syphilis for many years.,Neurosyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum bacteria. Neurosyphilis usually occurs about 10 to 20 years after a person is first infected with syphilis. Not everyone who has syphilis develops this complication. There are four different forms of neurosyphilis: Asymptomatic (most common form) General paresis Meningovascular Tabes dorsalis Asymptomatic neurosyphilis occurs before symptomatic syphilis. Asymptomatic means there aren't any symptoms.,"Symptoms usually affect the nervous system. Depending on the form of neurosyphilis, symptoms may include any of the following: Abnormal walk (gait), or unable to walk Numbness in the toes, feet, or legs Problems with thinking, such as confusion or poor concentration Mental problems, such as depression or irritability Headache, seizures , or stiff neck Loss of bladder control ( incontinence ) Tremors, or weakness Visual problems , even blindness",,Syphilis - neurosyphilis
Neutropenia - infants,Neutropenia is an abnormally low number of white blood cells. These cells are called neutrophils. They help the body fight infection. This article discusses neutropenia in newborns. Neutropenia can occur at any age.,"White blood cells (WBCs) are produced in the bone marrow. They are released into the bloodstream and travel wherever they are needed. Low levels of neutrophils occur when the bone marrow cannot replace them as fast as needed. In babies, the most common cause is infection. A very severe infection may cause neutrophils to be used up quickly. It may also prevent the bone marrow from producing more neutrophils. Sometimes, an infant who is not sick will have a low neutrophil count for no obvious reason. Some disorders in the pregnant mother, such as preeclampsia, can also lead to neutropenia in infants. In rare cases, mothers may have antibodies against their baby's neutrophils. These antibodies cross the placenta before birth and cause the baby's cells to break down (alloimmune neutropenia). In other rare cases, a problem with the baby's bone marrow may lead to decreased WBC production.",,,
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a group of conditions passed down through families. The disorder involves the skin, nervous system, eyes, endocrine glands, urinary and reproductive systems, and bones.","Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a rare genetic condition. The main gene linked to the syndrome is known as PTCH (patched). A second gene, called SUFU, has also been associated with this condition. Variations in these genes are most commonly passed down through families as an autosomal dominant trait. This means you develop the syndrome if either parent passes the gene to you. If either of your parents has this syndrome, you have a 50% chance of having it. It is also possible to develop this gene variation with no family history.","Main symptoms of this disorder are: A type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma that develops around the time of puberty A noncancerous tumor of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumor that also develops during puberty Other symptoms include: Broad nose Cleft palate Heavy, protruding brow Jaw that sticks out (in some cases) Wide-set eyes Pitting on palms and soles The condition may affect the nervous system and lead to: Eye problems Deafness Intellectual disability Seizures Tumors of the brain The condition also leads to bone defects, including: Curvature of the back ( scoliosis) Severe curvature of the back ( kyphosis ) Abnormal ribs",,NBCC syndrome; Gorlin syndrome; Gorlin-Goltz syndrome; Basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS); Basal cell cancer - nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome

Newborn jaundice,Newborn jaundice occurs when a baby has a high level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance that the body creates when it replaces old red blood cells. The liver helps break down the substance so it can be removed from the body in the stool.,"It is normal for a baby's bilirubin level to be a bit high after birth. When the baby is growing in the mother's womb (uterus), the placenta removes bilirubin from the baby's body. The placenta is the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the baby. After birth, the baby's liver starts doing this job. But, it may take some time for the baby's liver to be able to do this efficiently. Most newborns have some yellowing of the skin, or jaundice. This is called physiological jaundice. It is usually noticeable when the baby is 2 to 4 days old. Most of the time, it does not cause problems and goes away within 2 weeks. Two types of jaundice may occur in newborns who are breastfed. Both types are usually harmless. Breastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies during the first week of life. It is more likely to occur when babies do not nurse well or the mother's milk is slow to come, leading to dehydration. Breast milk jaundice may appear in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life. It is likely to peak during weeks 2 and 3, but may last at low levels for a month or more. The problem may be due to how substances in the breast milk affect the breakdown of bilirubin in the liver. Breast milk jaundice is different from breastfeeding jaundice. Severe newborn jaundice may occur if the baby has a condition that increases the number of red blood cells that need to be replaced in the body, such as: Abnormal blood cell shapes (such as sickle cell anemia ) Blood type mismatch between the mother and baby ( Rh incompatibility or ABO incompatibility) Bleeding underneath the scalp (cephalohematoma) caused by a difficult delivery Higher levels of red blood cells, which is more common in small-for-gestational age (SGA) babies and some twins Infection Lack of certain important proteins, called enzymes Things that make it harder for the baby's body to remove bilirubin may also lead to more severe jaundice, including: Certain medicines Infections present at birth, such as rubella , syphilis , and others Diseases that affect the liver or biliary tract, such as cystic fibrosis or hepatitis Low blood oxygen level (hypoxia) Infections (sepsis) Many different genetic or inherited disorders Babies who are born too early (premature) are more likely to develop jaundice than full-term babies.","Jaundice causes a yellow color of the skin.

Nicotine and tobacco,"The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine.","Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and the potential for addiction is still very strong. Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.","Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can: Decrease the appetite -- Fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking. Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression. Increase activity in the intestines. Create more saliva and phlegm. Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute. Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg. Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea. Stimulate memory and alertness -- People who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later.

Niemann-Pick disease,"Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a group of diseases passed down through families (inherited) in which fatty substances called lipids collect in the cells of the spleen, liver, and brain.","NPD types A and B occur when cells in the body do not have an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). This substance helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell in the body. If ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This kills your cells and makes it hard for organs to work properly. Type A occurs in all races and ethnicities. It is more common in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish population. Type C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and too much of other lipids in the brain. Type C is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent. Type C1 is a variant of type C. It involves a defect that interferes with how cholesterol moves between brain cells. This type has only been seen in French Canadian people in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.","Symptoms vary. Other health conditions may cause similar symptoms. The early stages of the disease may only cause a few symptoms. A person may never have all symptoms. Type A usually begins in the first few months of life. Symptoms may include: Abdominal (belly area) swelling within 3 to 6 months Cherry red spot at the back of the eye (on the retina ) Feeding difficulties Loss of early motor skills (gets worse over time) Type B symptoms are usually milder. They occur in late childhood or the teenage years. Abdominal swelling may occur in young children. There is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some children may have repeated respiratory infections. Types C and C1 usually affects school-age children. However, it may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood. Symptoms may include: Difficulty moving limbs that may lead to unsteady gait, clumsiness, walking problems Enlarged spleen Enlarged liver Jaundice at (or shortly after) birth Learning difficulties and intellectual decline Seizures Slurred, irregular speech Sudden loss of muscle tone that may lead to falls Tremors Trouble moving the eyes up and down",,NPD; Sphingomyelinase deficiency; Lipid storage disorder - Niemann-Pick disease; Lysosomal storage disease - Niemann-Pick
Night terrors in children,Night terrors (sleep terrors) are a sleep disorder in which a person quickly wakes from sleep in a terrified state.,"The cause is unknown, but night terrors may be triggered by: Fever Lack of sleep Periods of emotional tension, stress, or conflict Night terrors are most common in children ages 3 through 7, and much less common after that. Night terrors may run in families. They can occur in adults, especially when there is emotional tension or alcohol use.","Night terrors are most common during the first third of the night, often between midnight and 2 a.m. Children often scream and are very frightened and confused. They thrash around violently and are often not aware of their surroundings. The child may not be able to respond to being talked to, comforted, or awakened. The child may be sweating, breathing very fast ( hyperventilating ), have a fast heart rate , and widened (dilated) pupils. The spell may last 10 to 20 minutes, then the child goes back to sleep. Most children are unable to explain what happened the next morning. They often have no memory of the event when they wake up the next day. Children with night terrors may also sleep walk . In contrast, nightmares are more common in the early morning. They may occur after someone watches frightening movies or TV shows, or has an emotional experience. A person may remember the details of a dream after waking up and will not be disoriented after the episode.",,Pavor nocturnus; Sleep terror disorder
Nightmares,"A nightmare is a bad dream that brings out strong feelings of fear, terror, distress, or anxiety.","Nightmares usually begin before age 10 and are most often considered a normal part of childhood.

Risk factors include: A type of malnutrition called Kwashiorkor , and other forms of severe protein malnutrition Poor sanitation and dirty living conditions Disorders such as measles or leukemia Living in a developing country","Noma causes sudden tissue destruction that rapidly gets worse. First, the gums and lining of the cheeks become inflamed and develop sores (ulcers). The ulcers develop a foul-smelling drainage, causing bad breath and skin odor. The infection spreads to the skin, and the tissues in the lips and cheeks die. This can eventually destroy the soft tissue and bone. The destruction of the bones around the mouth causes deformity of the face and loss of teeth. Noma can also affect the genitals, spreading to the genital skin (this is sometimes called noma pudendi).",,Cancrum oris; Gangrenous stomatitis

Non-small cell lung cancer,Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer. It usually grows and spreads more slowly than small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45. Smoking causes most cases (around 80%) of non-small cell lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer. Research shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer. Constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include: Arsenic Asbestos Radon Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives Products using chloride and formaldehyde","Symptoms may include: Chest pain Cough that does not go away Coughing up blood Fatigue Loss of appetite Losing weight without trying Shortness of breath Wheezing Early lung cancer may not cause any symptoms.

Other ways this injury may happen include: Stopping a fall with the arm Rolling over in an unusual way Swinging a young child from their arms while playing Once the elbow dislocates, it is likely to do so again, especially in the 3 or 4 weeks after the injury. Nursemaid's elbow does not usually occur after age 5. By this time, a child's joints and the structures around them are stronger. Also, the child is less likely to be in a situation where this injury might occur. In some cases, the injury can happen in older children or adults, usually with a fracture of the forearm.","When the injury occurs: The child usually begins crying right away and refuses to use the arm because of elbow pain. The child may hold the arm slightly bent (flexed) at the elbow and pressed up against their belly (abdominal) area. The child will move the shoulder, but not the elbow. Some children stop crying as the first pain goes away, but continue to refuse to move their elbow.",,Radial head dislocation; Pulled elbow; Dislocated elbow - children; Elbow - nursemaid's; Elbow - pulled; Elbow subluxation; Dislocation - elbow - partial; Dislocation - radial head; Elbow pain - nursemaid's elbow
Nut allergies,"A nut allergy is a type of immune response triggered by tree nuts and peanuts. Peanuts are legumes, not nuts, but many people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to nuts. Nut allergies are a type of food allergy.","The immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called allergens . These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem. If you have a nut allergy, your immune system is overly reactive. When the body identifies a nut allergen, it launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. These symptoms occur every time you come in contact with even a small amount of the nut allergen. Risk factors for nut and other food allergies include: Having eczema as a child How early you were exposed to nuts in childhood Other theories suggest that changes to the microbiome may be a factor. The microbiome is all of the tiny organisms (bacteria, fungi, and others) that normally live on and in our bodies. A number of things may affect the microbiome, including cesarean birth, antibiotic use, and more people living in urban settings. Research is being done to better understand how these things affect the microbiome.","Symptoms usually begin quickly after eating nuts. Nut allergy symptoms include: Hives (urticaria) Skin rashes Itching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area Stomach cramps , diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting Stuffy nose, runny nose Swelling ( angioedema ), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing due to swelling in the throat Nut allergies can cause a life-threatening, whole-body reaction called anaphylaxis . In addition to the above symptoms, you may have low blood pressure and blocked airways. These severe allergy symptoms are a medical emergency.",,Food allergy - nuts; Peanut allergy; Nut allergy

Nystagmus,Nystagmus is a term to describe uncontrollable movements of the eyes that may be:,"NYSTAGMUS THAT IS PRESENT AT BIRTH (infantile nystagmus syndrome, or INS) INS is usually mild. It does not become more severe, and it is not related to any other disorder. People with this condition are usually not aware of the eye movements, but other people may see them. If the movements are large, sharpness of vision (visual acuity) may be less than 20/20. Surgery may improve vision. Nystagmus may be caused by congenital diseases of the eye. Although this is rare, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) should evaluate any child with nystagmus to check for eye disease. ACQUIRED NYSTAGMUS The most common cause of acquired nystagmus is certain drugs or medicines. Phenytoin (Dilantin) - an antiseizure medicine, excessive alcohol, or any sedating medicine can impair the labyrinth's function. Other causes include: Inner ear disorders such as benign positional vertigo , labyrinthitis or Meniere disease Head injury from motor vehicle accidents Stroke Infections such as Lyme disease and syphilis Thiamine or vitamin B12 deficiency Multiple sclerosis Brain tumors Autoimmune disease Paraneoplastic syndromes (due to cancer elsewhere in the body) Seizures Nystagmus can also be a symptom of other neurological disorders.",,"You may need to make changes in the home to help with dizziness , visual problems , or nervous system disorders.",Back and forth eye movements; Involuntary eye movements; Rapid eye movements from side to side; Uncontrolled eye movements; Eye movements - uncontrollable
Obesity,"Obesity means weighing more than what is healthy for a given height. Obesity is a serious, chronic disease. It can lead to other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.","Taking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by: Eating more food than your body can use Drinking too much alcohol Not getting enough exercise Many people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost. Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work as well as it should. The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults. The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat. We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active. Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals. Many people do not have ready access to healthy foods making it difficult to plan and make healthy meals. More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past. People with little free time may have less time to exercise. The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may have obesity, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time. Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause or contribute to weight gain, including: Underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism ) Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics Other things that can cause weight gain are: Quitting smoking -- Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds (lb) or 2 to 5 kilograms (kg) in the first 6 months after quitting. Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, depression, or not sleeping well. Menopause -- Women may gain 12 to 15 lb (5.5 to 7 kg) during menopause. Pregnancy -- Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.",,,Morbid obesity; Fat - obese
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS),Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) causes poor breathing in some people with obesity. It leads to lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide levels in the blood.,"The exact cause of OHS is not known. It is believed that OHS results from a defect in the brain's control over breathing. Excess weight against the chest wall also makes it harder for the muscles to draw in a deep breath and to breathe quickly enough. This worsens the brain's breathing control. As a result, the blood contains too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen. During stable conditions, people are not acidemic as the kidneys have enough time to correct the acidity caused by the high carbon dioxide.",The main symptoms of OHS are due to lack of sleep and include: Poor sleep quality Sleep apnea Daytime sleepiness Depression Headaches Tiredness Symptoms of low blood oxygen level (chronic hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide can occur. Symptoms include shortness of breath or feeling tired after little effort.,,Pickwickian syndrome
Obesity in children,"Obesity in children means having a weight that is higher than what is healthy for a child’s height. Obesity is a serious, chronic disease. Over time, it can lead to other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.","When children eat more food than their bodies need for normal growth and activity, the extra calories are stored in fat cells for later use. If this pattern continues over time, they develop more fat cells and may develop obesity. Normally, infants and young children respond to signals of hunger and fullness so that they do not consume more calories than their bodies need. However, changes over the last few decades in lifestyle and food choices have led to the rise of obesity among children . Children are surrounded by many things that make it easy to overeat and harder to be active. Foods that are high in fat and sugar content often come in large portion sizes. These factors can lead children to take in more calories than they need before they feel full. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices . Most of the time, the food in ads aimed at children is high in sugar, salt, or fats. "" Screen time "" activities such as watching television, gaming, texting, and playing on the computer require very little energy. They often take the place of healthy physical exercise. Also, children tend to crave unhealthy snack foods they see in TV ads. Other factors in the child's environment can also lead to obesity. Family, friends, and school setting help shape a child's diet and exercise choices. Food may be used as a reward or to comfort a child. These learned habits can lead to overeating. Many people have a hard time breaking these habits later in life. Genetics, medical conditions, and emotional disorders can also increase a child's risk for obesity. Hormone disorders or low thyroid function, and certain medicines, such as steroids or anti-seizure medicines, can increase a child's appetite. Over time, this increases their risk for obesity. An unhealthy focus on eating, weight, and body image can lead to an eating disorder. Obesity and eating disorders often occur at the same time in teenage girls and young adult women who may be unhappy with their body image.",,,Obese - children
Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which people have unwanted and repeated thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations (obsessions), and behaviors that drive them to do something over and over (compulsions).","Health care providers do not know the exact cause of OCD. Factors that may play a role include prior head injury, infections, and abnormal function in certain areas of the brain. Genes (family history) seems to play a strong role. A history of physical or sexual abuse also appears to increase the risk for OCD. Parents and teachers often recognize OCD symptoms in children. Most people are diagnosed by age 19 or 20, but some do not show symptoms until age 30.","People with OCD have repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. These are called obsessions. Examples are: Excessive fear of germs Forbidden thoughts related to sex, religion, or harm to others or self Need for order They also perform repeated behaviors in response to their thoughts or obsessions. These are called compulsions. Examples include: Checking and rechecking actions (such as turning out the lights and locking the door) Excessive counting Ordering things in a certain way Repeatedly washing the hands to ward off infection Repeating words silently Praying silently over and over Not everyone who has habits or rituals they like to perform has OCD. But, the person with OCD: Is not able to control their thoughts or behaviors, even when they understand that they are excessive. Spends at least an hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors. Does not get pleasure from performing a behavior or ritual, other than perhaps brief relief of anxiety. Has major problems in daily life due to these thoughts and rituals. People with OCD may also have a tic disorder, such as: Eye blinking Facial grimacing Shoulder shrugging Head jerking Repeated clearing of the throat, sniffing, or grunting sounds",,Obsessive-compulsive neurosis; OCD
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a mental condition in which a person is preoccupied with:,"OCPD tends to occur in families, so genes may be involved. A person's childhood and environment may also play roles. This disorder can affect both men and women. It occurs most often in men.","OCPD has some of the same symptoms as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with OCD have unwanted thoughts, while people with OCPD believe that their thoughts are correct. In addition, OCD often begins in childhood while OCPD usually starts in the teen years or early 20s. People with either OCPD or OCD are high achievers and feel a sense of urgency about their actions. They may become very upset if other people interfere with their rigid routines. They may not be able to express their anger directly. People with OCPD have feelings that they consider more appropriate, like anxiety or frustration. A person with OCPD has symptoms of perfectionism that usually begin by early adulthood. This perfectionism may interfere with the person's ability to complete tasks because their standards are so rigid. They may withdraw emotionally when they are not able to control a situation. This can interfere with their ability to solve problems and form close relationships. Other signs of OCPD include: Over-devotion to work Not being able to throw things away, even when the objects have no value Lack of flexibility Lack of generosity Not wanting to allow other people to do things Not willing to show affection Preoccupation with details, rules, and lists",,Personality disorder - obsessive-compulsive; OCPD
Obstructive sleep apnea - adults,Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a problem in which your breathing pauses during sleep. This occurs because of narrowed or blocked airways.,"When you sleep, all of the muscles in your body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep your throat open so air can flow into your lungs. Normally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. Some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea. Loud snoring is a telltale symptom of OSA. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. Not everyone who snores has OSA though. Watch this video about: Snoring Other factors also may increase your risk: A lower jaw that is short compared to your upper jaw Certain shapes of the roof of your mouth (palate) or airway that cause it to collapse more easily Large neck or collar size, 17 inches (43 centimeters) or more in men and 16 in (41 cm) or more in women Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway Obesity Large tonsils and adenoids that can block the airway Sleeping on your back can also cause your airway to become blocked or narrowed. Central sleep apnea is a different sleep disorder during which breathing also can stop. It occurs when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.","If you have OSA, you usually begin snoring heavily soon after falling asleep. The snoring often becomes very loud. Snoring may be interrupted by a long silent period while your breathing stops. The silence is followed by a loud snort and gasp, as you attempt to breathe. This pattern repeats throughout the night. Most people with OSA do not know their breathing starts and stops during the night. Usually, a sleep partner or other family members hear the loud snoring, gasping, and snorting. Snoring can be loud enough to hear through walls. Sometimes, people with OSA wake up gasping for air. People with sleep apnea may: Wake up unrefreshed in the morning Feel sleepy or drowsy throughout the day Act grumpy, impatient, or irritable Be forgetful Fall asleep while working, reading, or watching TV Feel sleepy while driving, or even fall asleep while driving Have hard-to-treat headaches Other problems that may occur include: Depression Hyperactive behavior, especially in children Difficult to treat high blood pressure Headaches , especially in the morning",,Sleep apnea - obstructive - adults; Apnea - obstructive sleep apnea syndrome - adults; Sleep-disordered breathing - adults; OSA - adults
Obstructive uropathy,Obstructive uropathy is a condition in which the flow of urine is blocked. This causes the urine to back up and injure one or both kidneys.,Obstructive uropathy occurs when urine cannot drain through the urinary tract. Urine backs up into the kidneys and may cause them to become swollen. This condition is known as hydronephrosis . Obstructive uropathy can affect one or both kidneys. It can occur suddenly or be a long-term problem. Common causes of obstructive uropathy include: Bladder stones Kidney stones Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) Advanced prostate cancer Bladder or ureteral cancer Bladder prolapse (also called dropped bladder) Colon cancer Cervical or uterine cancer Ovarian cancer Any cancer that spreads Scar tissue that occurs inside or outside of the ureters Scar tissue that occurs inside the urethra Problems with the nerves that supply the bladder,"Symptoms depend on whether the problem starts slowly or suddenly and if one or both kidneys are involved. Symptoms may include: Mild to severe pain in the flank. The pain may be felt on one or both sides. Fever. Nausea or vomiting. Weight gain or swelling (edema) of kidney. You may also have problems passing urine, such as: Urge to urinate often Decrease in the force of urine stream or difficulty urinating Dribbling of urine Not feeling as if the bladder is emptied Need to urinate more often at night Decreased amount of urine Leakage of urine (urinary incontinence) Blood in urine",,Uropathy - obstructive
Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is a lung disorder in which substances found in the workplace cause the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow. This leads to attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.","Asthma is caused by inflammation (swelling) in the airways of the lungs. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways activate. This makes the airways narrower and reduces the amount of air that can pass through. In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called triggers. Many substances in the workplace can trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals. The following workers are at higher risk: Bakers Detergent manufacturers Drug manufacturers Farmers Grain elevator workers Laboratory workers (especially those working with laboratory animals) Metal workers Millers Plastics workers Woodworkers","Symptoms are usually due to narrowing of the airways and tightening spasms of the muscles lining the airways. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through, which can lead to wheezing sounds. Symptoms usually occur shortly after you are exposed to the substance. They often improve or go away when you leave work. Some people may not have symptoms until 12 or more hours after being exposed to the trigger. Symptoms usually get worse toward the end of the work week and may go away on weekends or vacations. Symptoms include: Coughing Shortness of breath Tight feeling in the chest Wheezing",,Asthma - occupational exposure; Irritant-induced reactive airways disease
Occupational hearing loss,Occupational hearing loss is damage to the inner ear from noise or vibrations due to certain types of jobs.,"Over time, repeated exposure to loud noise or music can cause hearing loss. Watch this video about: Hearing and the cochlea Sounds above 80 decibels (dB, a measurement of the loudness or strength of sound vibration) may cause vibrations intense enough to damage the inner ear. This is more likely to happen if the sound continues for a long time. Examples of sound intensity are: 90 dB -- a large truck 5 yards (4.5 meters) away (motorcycles, snowmobiles, and similar engines range from 85 to 90 dB) 100 dB -- some rock concerts 120 dB -- a jackhammer about 3 feet (1 meter) away 130 dB -- a jet engine from 100 feet (30 meters) away A general rule of thumb is that if you need to shout to be heard, the sound is in the range that can damage hearing. Some jobs carry a high risk for hearing loss , such as: Airline ground maintenance Construction Farming Jobs involving loud music or machinery Military jobs that involve combat, aircraft noise, or other posts with loud noises In the United States, laws regulate the maximum job noise exposure that it is allowed. Both the length of exposure and decibel level are considered. If the sound is at or greater than the maximum levels recommended, you need to take steps to protect your hearing.",The main symptom is partial or complete hearing loss. The hearing loss will likely get worse over time with continued exposure. Noise in the ear ( tinnitus ) may accompany hearing loss.,,Hearing loss - occupational; Noise-induced hearing loss; Noise notch

Omphalocele,An omphalocele is a birth defect in which an infant's intestine or other abdominal organs are outside of the body because of a hole in the belly button (navel) area. The intestines are covered only by a thin layer of tissue and can be easily seen.,"An omphalocele is considered an abdominal wall defect (a hole in the abdominal wall). The child's intestines usually stick out (protrude) through the hole. The condition looks similar to gastroschisis . An omphalocele is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs protrude through a hole in the belly button area and are covered with a membrane. In gastroschisis, there is no covering membrane. Abdominal wall defects develop as a baby grows inside the mother's womb. During development, the intestines and other organs (liver, bladder, stomach, and ovaries or testes) develop outside the body at first and then usually return inside. In babies with omphalocele, the intestines and other organs remain outside the abdominal wall, with a membrane covering them. The exact cause for abdominal wall defects is not known. Infants with an omphalocele often have other birth defects. Defects include genetic problems (chromosomal abnormalities), congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and heart and kidney defects. These problems also affect the overall outlook (prognosis) for the baby's health and survival.","An omphalocele can be clearly seen.

Opiate and opioid withdrawal,Opiates or opioids are drugs used to treat pain. Opiates are derived from plants and opioids are synthetic drugs that have the same actions as opiates. The term narcotic refers to either type of drug.,"In 2018 in the United States, about 808,000 people reported using heroin during the past year. In the same year, about 11.4 million people used narcotic pain relievers without a prescription. Narcotic pain relievers include: Codeine Heroin Hydrocodone (Vicodin) Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) Methadone Meperidine (Demerol) Morphine Oxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin) Fentanyl These drugs can cause physical dependence . This means that a person needs to take the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Over time, more of the drug is needed for the same effect. This is called drug tolerance. How long it takes to become physically dependent varies with each person. When the person stops taking the drugs the body needs time to recover. This causes withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal from opiates can occur any time long-term use is stopped or cut back.",Early symptoms of withdrawal include: Agitation Anxiety Muscle aches Increased tearing Insomnia Runny nose Sweating Yawning Late symptoms of withdrawal include: Abdominal cramping Diarrhea Dilated pupils Goosebumps Nausea Vomiting These symptoms are very uncomfortable but are not life threatening.

They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes, they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. When abused, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and intensely happy (euphoria). In short, the drugs are used to get high.","Opioid intoxication may occur when a health care provider prescribes an opioid, but: The provider doesn't know the person is already taking another opioid at home. The person has a health problem, such as a liver or kidney problem, that may easily result in intoxication. The provider prescribes a sleep medicine (sedative) in addition to the opioid. The provider doesn't know that another provider already prescribed an opioid.

It may also occur on the: Cheek lining Floor of the mouth Gums (gingiva) Roof of the mouth (palate) Most oral cancers are a type called squamous cell carcinoma. These cancers tend to spread quickly. Smoking and other tobacco use are linked to most cases of oral cancer. Heavy alcohol use also increases the risk for oral cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (the same virus that causes genital warts ) account for a larger number of oral cancers than in the past. One type of HPV, type 16 or HPV-16, is much more commonly associated with almost all oral cancers. Other factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include: Long-term (chronic) rubbing, such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings Taking medicines (immunosuppressants) that weaken the immune system Poor dental and oral hygiene Some oral cancers begin as a white plaque ( leukoplakia ) or as a mouth ulcer .

It is more common in men older than 40.","Oral cancer can appear as a lump or ulcer in the mouth that may be: A deep, hard-edged crack in the tissue Pale, dark red, or discolored On the tongue, lip, or other area of the mouth Painless at first, then a burning sensation or pain when the tumor is more advanced Other symptoms may include:: Chewing problems Mouth sores that may bleed Pain with swallowing Speech difficulties Swallowing difficulty Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Tongue problems Weight loss Difficulty opening the mouth Numbness and loosening of teeth Bad breath",,Cancer - mouth; Mouth cancer; Head and neck cancer - oral; Squamous cell cancer - mouth; Malignant neoplasm - oral; Oropharyngeal cancer - HPV; Carcinoma - mouth
Oral human papillomavirus infection,Human papillomavirus infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The infection is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).,Oral HPV is thought to spread mainly through oral sex and deep tongue kissing. The virus passes from one person to another during sexual activity. Your risk of getting the infection goes up if you: Have more sexual partners Use tobacco or alcohol Have a weak immune system Men are more likely to have oral HPV infection than women. Certain types of HPV are known to cause cancer of the throat or larynx . This is called oropharyngeal cancer. HPV-16 is associated with almost all oral cancers.,"Oral HPV infection shows no symptoms. You can have HPV without ever knowing it. You can pass on the virus because you don't know you have it. Most people who develop oropharyngeal cancer from an HPV infection have had the infection for a long time.

It may begin suddenly or be a result of an infection that gradually becomes worse.","Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than periorbital cellulitis , which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye. In children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza. The infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection. The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness.

Orgasmic dysfunction in women,"Orgasmic dysfunction is when a woman either cannot reach orgasm, or has trouble reaching orgasm when she is sexually excited.","About 10% to 15% of women have never had an orgasm. Surveys suggest that up to one half of women are not satisfied with how often they reach orgasm. Sexual response involves the mind and body working together in a complex way. Both need to function well for an orgasm to happen. Many factors can lead to problems reaching orgasm. They include: A history of sexual abuse or rape Boredom in sexual activity or a relationship Fatigue, stress or depression Lack of knowledge about sexual function Negative feelings about sex (often learned in childhood or teen years) Shyness or embarrassment about asking for the type of touching that works best Partner issues Health problems that can cause problems reaching orgasm include: Certain drugs that are prescribed.

Osgood-Schlatter disease,"Osgood-Schlatter disease is a painful swelling of the bump on the upper part of the shinbone, just below the knee. This bump is called the anterior tibial tubercle.","Osgood-Schlatter disease is thought to be caused by small injuries to the knee area from overuse before the knee is finished growing. The quadriceps muscle is a large, strong muscle on the front part of the upper leg. When this muscle squeezes (contracts), it straightens the knee. The quadriceps muscle is an important muscle for running, jumping, and climbing. When the quadriceps muscle is used a lot in sports activities during a child's growth spurt, this area becomes irritated or swollen and causes pain. It is common in adolescents who play soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and who participate in gymnastics. Osgood-Schlatter disease affects more boys than girls.","The main symptom is painful swelling over a bump on the lower leg bone (shinbone). Symptoms occur on one or both legs.

Osmotic demyelination syndrome,"Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) leads to brain cell dysfunction. It is caused by the destruction of the layer (myelin sheath) covering nerve cells in the brain, most often the middle of the brainstem (pons).","When the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells is destroyed, signals from one nerve to another aren't properly transmitted. Although the brainstem is mainly affected, other areas of the brain can also be involved. The most common cause of ODS is a quick change in the body's blood sodium levels. This most often occurs when someone is being treated for low blood sodium ( hyponatremia ) and the sodium is replaced too fast. Sometimes, it occurs when a high level of sodium in the body (hypernatremia) is corrected too quickly. ODS does not usually occur on its own. Most often, it's a complication of treatment for other problems, or from the other problems themselves. Risks include: Alcohol use Liver disease Malnutrition from serious illnesses Radiation treatment of the brain Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy","Symptoms may include any of the following: Confusion , delirium , hallucinations Balance problems, tremor Problem swallowing Reduced alertness , drowsiness or sleepiness , lethargy , poor responses Slurred speech (dysarthria) Weakness in the face, arms, or legs, usually affecting both sides of the body",,ODS; Central pontine demyelination; Central pontine myelinolysis

Osteitis fibrosa,"Osteitis fibrosa is a complication of hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which overactive parathyroid glands cause certain bones to become abnormally weak and deformed.","The parathyroid glands are 4 tiny glands in the neck. These glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for healthy bones. Too much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) can lead to increased bone breakdown, which can cause bones to become weaker and more fragile. Many people with hyperparathyroidism eventually develop osteoporosis . Not all bones respond to PTH in the same way. Some develop abnormal areas where the bone is very soft and has almost no calcium in it. This is osteitis fibrosa. In rare cases, parathyroid cancer causes osteitis fibrosa. Osteitis fibrosa is now very rare in people who have hyperparathyroidism and good access to medical care. It is more common in people who develop hyperparathyroidism at a young age, or have untreated hyperparathyroidism for a long time.","Osteitis fibrosa may cause bone pain or tenderness. There may be fractures (breaks) in the arms, legs, or spine, or other bone problems. Hyperparathyroidism itself may cause any of the following: Nausea Constipation Fatigue Frequent urination Weakness",,Osteitis fibrosa cystica; Hyperparathyroidism - osteitis fibrosa; Brown tumor of bone
Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder. It is due to aging and wear and tear on a joint.,"Cartilage is the firm, rubbery tissue that cushions your bones at the joints. It allows bones to glide over one another when the joint moves. When the cartilage breaks down and wears away, the fragments of the cartilage or the bones rub together. This often causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of OA. As OA worsens, bony spurs or extra bone may form around the joint. The ligaments and muscles around the joint may become weaker and stiffer. Before age 55, OA occurs equally in men and women. After age 55, it is more common in women. Other factors can also lead to OA. OA tends to run in families. Being overweight increases the risk for OA in the hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints. This is because extra weight causes more wear and tear. Fractures or other joint injuries can lead to OA later in life. This includes injuries to the cartilage and ligaments in your joints. Jobs that involve kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day, or involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking increase the risk for OA. Playing sports that involve direct impact on the joint (football), twisting (basketball or soccer), or throwing also increase the risk for OA. Medical conditions that can lead to OA or symptoms similar to OA include: Bleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as hemophilia Disorders that block the blood supply near a joint and lead to bone death ( avascular necrosis ) Other types of arthritis, such as long-term (chronic) gout , pseudogout , or rheumatoid arthritis Watch this video about: Osteoarthritis","Symptoms of OA often appear in middle age. Almost everyone has some symptoms of OA by age 70. Pain and stiffness in the joints are the most common symptoms. The pain is often worse: After exercise When you put weight or pressure on the joint When you use the joint With OA, your joints may become stiffer and harder to move over time. You may notice a rubbing, grating, or crackling sound when you move the joint. Morning stiffness refers to the pain and stiffness you feel when you first wake up in the morning. Stiffness due to OA often lasts for 30 minutes or less. It can last more than 30 minutes if there is inflammation in the joint. It often improves after activity, allowing the joint to warm up. During the day, the pain may get worse when you are active and feel better when you are resting. As OA gets worse, you may have pain even when you are resting. And it may wake you up at night. Some people might not have symptoms, even though x-rays show the physical changes of OA.",,Hypertrophic osteoarthritis; Osteoarthrosis; Degenerative joint disease; DJD; OA; Arthritis - osteoarthritis
Osteogenesis imperfecta,Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition causing extremely fragile bones.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is present at birth. It is often caused by a defect in the gene that produces type I collagen, an important building block of bone. There are many defects that can affect this gene. The severity of OI depends on the specific gene defect. If you have one copy of the gene, you will have the disease. Most cases of OI are inherited from a parent. However, some cases are the result of new genetic mutations. A person with OI has a 50% chance of passing on the gene and the disease to their children.","All people with OI have weak bones, and fractures are more likely. People with OI are most often below average height ( short stature ). However, the severity of the disease varies greatly. The classic symptoms include: Blue tint to the whites of their eyes (blue sclera) Multiple bone fractures Early hearing loss ( deafness ) Because type I collagen is also found in ligaments, people with OI often have loose joints (hypermobility) and flat feet. Some types of OI also lead to the development of poor teeth. Symptoms of more severe forms of OI may include: Bowed legs and arms Kyphosis Scoliosis (S-curve spine)",,Brittle bone disease; Congenital disease; OI
Osteomalacia,"Osteomalacia is softening of the bones. It most often occurs because of a problem that leads to vitamin D deficiency, which helps your body absorb calcium. Your body needs calcium to maintain the strength and hardness of your bones.","A lack of the proper amount of calcium in the blood can lead to weak and soft bones. Low blood calcium can be caused by low vitamin D level in the blood. Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D produced by the skin may occur in people who: Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight Must stay indoors Work indoors during the daylight hours Wear clothes that cover most of their skin Have dark skin pigmentation Use very strong sunscreen You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you: Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products) Do not eat or drink milk products (more common in older adults) Follow a vegetarian diet Are not able to absorb vitamin D well in the intestines, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to a gastrointestinal disease Other conditions that may cause osteomalacia include: Cancer -- rare tumors that cause low phosphate level in the blood Kidney failure and acidosis Lack of enough phosphates in the diet Liver disease -- the liver cannot convert vitamin D to its active form Side effects of medicines used to treat seizures","Symptoms include: Bone fractures that happen without a significant injury Muscle weakness Widespread bone pain , especially in the hips Symptoms may also occur due to a low calcium level. These include: Numbness around the mouth Numbness or tingling of the arms and legs Spasms or cramps of the hands or feet",,Vitamin D deficiency - osteomalacia; Calcium - osteomalacia
Osteomyelitis,Osteomyelitis is a bone infection. It is caused by bacteria or other germs.,"A bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. But it can also be caused by fungi or other germs. When a person has osteomyelitis: Bacteria or other germs may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore. The infection can start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood. The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone. In children, the long bones of the arms or legs are most often involved. In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected. Risk factors are: Diabetes Hemodialysis Poor blood supply Recent injury Use of injected illicit drugs Surgery involving bones Weakened immune system","Symptoms of osteomyelitis are often not specific and vary with age. Main symptoms include: Bone pain Excessive sweating Fever and chills General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Local swelling , redness, and warmth Open wound that may show pus Pain at the site of infection",,Bone infection
Osteomyelitis in children,Osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by bacteria or other germs.,"A bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by fungi or other germs. In children, the long bones of the arms or legs are most often involved. When a child has osteomyelitis: Bacteria or other germs may spread to the bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore. The infection can start in another part of the body and spread through the blood to the bone. The infection can be caused by an injury that breaks the skin and bone (open fracture). Bacteria can enter the skin and infect the bone. The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury, or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone. Other risk factors include: Premature birth or delivery complications in newborns Diabetes Poor blood supply Recent injury Sickle cell disease Infection due to a foreign body Pressure ulcers Human bites or animal bites Weak immune system","Osteomyelitis symptoms include: Bone pain Excessive sweating Fever and chills General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Local swelling , redness, and warmth Pain at the infection site Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs Refusing to walk (when leg bones are involved) Infants with osteomyelitis may not have a fever or other signs of illness.

Osteonecrosis,"Osteonecrosis is bone death caused by poor blood supply. It is most common in the hip and shoulder but can affect other large joints such as the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle.","Osteonecrosis occurs when part of the bone does not get blood flow and dies. After a while, the bone can collapse. If osteonecrosis is not treated, the joint deteriorates, leading to severe arthritis. Osteonecrosis can be caused by disease or by severe trauma, such as a fracture or dislocation , that affects the blood supply to the bone. Osteonecrosis can also occur without trauma or disease. This is called idiopathic -- meaning it occurs without any known cause. The following are possible causes: Using oral or intravenous steroids Excessive alcohol use Sickle cell disease or any blood condition that causes abnormal blood clotting Dislocation or fractures around a joint Clotting disorders HIV or taking HIV drugs Radiation therapy or chemotherapy Gaucher disease (disease in which harmful substances build-up in certain organs and the bones) Systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue such as the skin, joints, and certain organs) Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (childhood disease in which the thigh bone in the hip doesn't get enough blood, causing the bone to die) Decompression sickness from a lot of deep sea diving When osteonecrosis occurs in the shoulder joint, it is usually due to long-term treatment with steroids, a history of trauma to the shoulder, or the person has sickle cell disease or any abnormal blood clotting conditions.","There are no symptoms in the early stages. As bone damage worsens, you may have the following symptoms: Pain in the joint that may increase over time and becomes severe if the bone collapses Pain that occurs even at rest Limited range of motion Groin pain, if the hip joint is affected Limping, if the condition occurs in the leg Difficulty with overhead movement, if the shoulder joint is affected Worsening arthritic symptoms in the joint when the condition deteriorates",,Avascular necrosis; Bone infarction; Ischemic bone necrosis; AVN; Aseptic necrosis
Osteopenia - premature infants,Osteopenia is a decrease in the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the bone. This can cause bones to be weak and brittle. It increases the risk for broken bones.,"During the last 3 months of pregnancy, large amounts of calcium and phosphorus are transferred from the mother to the baby. This helps the baby grow. A premature infant may not receive the proper amount of calcium and phosphorus needed to form strong bones. While in the womb, fetal activity increases during the last 3 months of pregnancy. This activity is thought to be important for bone development. Most very premature infants have limited physical activity. This may also contribute to weak bones. Very premature babies lose much more phosphorus in their urine than do babies that are born full-term. A lack of vitamin D may also lead to osteopenia in infants. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium from the intestines and kidneys. If babies do not receive or make enough vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous will not be properly absorbed. A liver problem called cholestasis may also cause problems with vitamin D levels. Water pills (diuretics) or steroids can also cause low calcium levels.","Most premature infants born before 30 weeks have some degree of osteopenia, but will not have any physical symptoms. Infants with severe osteopenia may have decreased movement or swelling of an arm or leg due to an unknown fracture.",,Neonatal rickets; Brittle bones - premature infants; Weak bones - premature infants; Osteopenia of prematurity
Osteoporosis,Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and more likely to break (fracture).,"Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease. Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebrae (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common. Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones. During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone. As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong. Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created. Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss. Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker. Watch this video about: Osteoporosis A major risk is not consuming enough calcium to build new bone tissue. It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if: If you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D Your body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to other medical conditions Other causes of bone loss include: A decrease in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a decrease in testosterone in men as they age Being confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children) Having certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis Taking certain medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, hormone treatments for prostate or breast cancer , and steroid medicines taken for more than 3 months Other risk factors include: Absence of menstrual periods for long periods of time A family history of osteoporosis Drinking a large amount of alcohol Low body weight Smoking Having an eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa Certain ethnic groups have a higher rate of low bone mass","There are no symptoms in the early stages of osteoporosis. Many times, people will have a fracture before learning they have the disease. Fractures of the bones of the spine can cause pain almost anywhere in the spine. These are called compression fractures . They often occur without an injury. The pain may occur suddenly or slowly over time. There can be a loss of height (as much as 6 inches or 15 centimeters) over time.

Osteosarcoma,Osteosarcoma is a very rare type of cancerous bone tumor that usually develops in teenagers and young adults. It often occurs when a teen is growing rapidly.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children. Average age at diagnosis is 15. Boys and girls are just as likely to develop this tumor until the late teens, after which it occurs more often in boys. Osteosarcoma is also common in people over age 60. The cause is not known. In some cases, osteosarcoma runs in families. At least one gene has been linked to an increased risk. This gene is also associated with familial retinoblastoma . This is a cancer of the eye that occurs in children. Osteosarcoma tends to occur in the bones of the: Shin (near the knee) Thigh (near the knee) Upper arm (near the shoulder) Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in large bones in the area of bone with the fastest growth rate. However, it can occur in any bone.","The first symptom is usually bone pain near a joint. This symptom may be overlooked, especially in young people, because of other more common causes of joint pain.

Otitis,Otitis is a term for infection or inflammation of the ear.,"Otitis can affect the inner or outer parts of the ear. The condition can be: Acute ear infection -- Starts suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. It is often painful. Chronic ear infection -- Occurs when the ear infection does not go away or keeps coming back. It may cause long-term damage to the ear. Based on location otitis can be: Otitis externa (swimmer's ear) -- Involves the outer ear and ear canal. A more severe form can spread into the bones and cartilage around the ear. Otitis media (ear infection) -- Involves the middle ear, which is located just behind the eardrum. Otitis media with effusion -- Occurs when there is thick or sticky fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection.",,,Ear infection; Infection - ear
Otitis media with effusion,Otitis media with effusion (OME) is thick or sticky fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear. It occurs without an ear infection.,"The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed. OME and ear infections are connected in two ways: After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks. When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear . Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection. The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid in the middle ear: Allergies Irritants (particularly cigarette smoke) Respiratory infections The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked: Drinking while lying on your back Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road) Getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked Eustachian tube. OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns. Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons: The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter. The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block. Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses. The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (""Glue ear"" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to be related to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.","Unlike children with an ear infection, children with OME do not act sick. OME often does not have obvious symptoms. Older children and adults often complain of muffled hearing or a sense of fullness in the ear.

People who have otosclerosis have an abnormal extension of sponge-like bone growing in the middle ear cavity. This growth prevents the ear bones from vibrating normally in response to sound waves. These vibrations are needed in order for you to hear. Otosclerosis is the most common cause of middle ear hearing loss in young adults. It typically begins in early to mid-adulthood. It is more common in women than in men. The condition may affect one or both ears. Risks for this condition include pregnancy and a family history of hearing loss. White people are more likely to develop this condition than people of other races.,"Symptoms include: Hearing loss (slow at first, but worsens over time) Ringing in the affected ear ( tinnitus ) Vertigo or dizziness",,Otospongiosis; Hearing loss - otosclerosis
Ovarian cancer,Ovarian cancer is cancer that starts in the ovaries. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs.,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women. It causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive organ cancer. The cause of ovarian cancer is unknown. Risks of developing ovarian cancer include any of the following: The fewer children a woman has and the later in life she gives birth, the higher her risk for ovarian cancer. Women who have had breast cancer or have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer have an increased risk for ovarian cancer (due to defects in genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2). Women who take estrogen replacement only (not with progesterone) for 5 years or more may have a higher risk for ovarian cancer. Birth control pills, though, decrease the risk for ovarian cancer. Fertility medicine probably does not increase the risk for ovarian cancer. Older women are at highest risk of developing ovarian cancer. Most deaths from ovarian cancer occur in women age 55 and older.","Ovarian cancer symptoms are often vague. Women and their doctors often blame the symptoms on other, more common conditions. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, the tumor has often spread beyond the ovaries. See your doctor if you have the following symptoms on a daily basis for more than a few weeks: Bloating or swelling in the belly area Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly (early satiety) Pelvic or lower abdominal pain (area may feel ""heavy"") Back pain Swollen lymph nodes in groin Other symptoms that can occur: Excessive hair growth that is coarse and dark Sudden urge to urinate Needing to urinate more often than usual ( increased urinary frequency or urgency ) Constipation",,Cancer - ovaries
Ovarian cysts,An ovarian cyst is a sac filled with fluid that forms on or inside an ovary.,"Each month during your menstrual cycle, a follicle (cyst) grows on your ovary. The follicle is where an egg is developing. The follicle makes the estrogen hormone. This hormone causes normal changes of the uterine lining as the uterus prepares for pregnancy. When the egg matures, it is released from the follicle. This is called ovulation. If the follicle fails to break open and release an egg, the fluid stays in the follicle and forms a cyst . This is called a follicular cyst. Another type of cyst occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. This is called a corpus luteum cyst. This type of cyst may contain a small amount of blood. This cyst makes progesterone and estrogen hormones. Ovarian cysts are more common in the childbearing years between puberty and menopause . The condition is less common after menopause. Taking fertility medicines often causes the development of multiple follicles (cysts) in the ovaries. These cysts most often go away after a woman's period, or after a pregnancy. Functional ovarian cysts are not the same as ovarian tumors or cysts due to hormone-related conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome .","Ovarian cysts often cause no symptoms. An ovarian cyst is more likely to cause pain if it: Becomes large Bleeds Breaks open Interferes with the blood supply to the ovary Is twisted or causes twisting (torsion) of the ovary Symptoms of ovarian cysts can also include: Bloating or swelling in the abdomen Pain during bowel movements Pain in the pelvis shortly before or after beginning a menstrual period Pain with intercourse or pelvic pain during movement Pelvic pain -- constant, dull aching Sudden and severe pelvic pain, often with nausea and vomiting (may be a sign of torsion or twisting of the ovary on its blood supply, or rupture of a cyst with internal bleeding) Changes in menstrual periods are not common with follicular cysts. These are more common with corpus luteum cysts. Spotting or bleeding may occur with some cysts.",,Physiologic ovarian cysts; Functional ovarian cysts; Corpus luteum cysts; Follicular cysts
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a problem that is sometimes seen in women who take fertility medicines that stimulate egg production.,"Normally, a woman produces one egg per month. Some women who have trouble getting pregnant may be given medicines to help them produce and release eggs. If these medicines stimulate the ovaries too much, the ovaries can become very swollen. Fluid can leak into the belly and chest area. This is called OHSS. This occurs only after the eggs are released from the ovary (ovulation). You may be more likely to get OHSS if: You receive a shot of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). You get more than one dose of hCG after ovulation. You become pregnant during this cycle. OHSS rarely occurs in women who only take fertility drugs by mouth. OHSS affects 3% to 6% of women who go through in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other risk factors for OHSS include: Being younger than age 35 Having a very high estrogen level during fertility treatments Developing an unusually large number of ovarian follicles with your fertility treatment Having polycystic ovarian syndrome Low body weight","The symptoms of OHSS can range from mild to severe. Most women with the condition have mild symptoms such as: Abdominal bloating Mild pain in the abdomen Weight gain In rare cases, women can have more serious symptoms, including: Rapid weight gain (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms in 3 to 5 days) Severe pain or swelling in the belly area Decreased urination Shortness of breath Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Blood clots",,OHSS
Ovarian overproduction of androgens,Ovarian overproduction of androgens is a condition in which the ovaries make too much testosterone. This leads to the development of male characteristics in a woman. Androgens from other parts of the body can also cause male characteristics to develop in women.,"In healthy women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce about 40% to 50% of the body's testosterone. Tumors of the ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can both cause too much androgen production. Cushing disease is a problem with the pituitary gland that leads to excess amounts of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may cause masculine body changes in women. Tumors in the adrenal glands can also cause too much production of androgens and can lead to male body characteristics in women.","High levels of androgens in a female can cause: Acne Changes in female body shape Decrease in breast size Increase in body hair in a male pattern, such as on the face, chin, and abdomen (called hirsutism) Lack of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) Oily skin These changes may also occur: Increase in the size of the clitoris Deepening of the voice Increase in muscle mass Thinning hair and hair loss at the front of the scalp on both sides of the head",,

Paget disease of the bone,Paget disease is a disorder that involves abnormal bone destruction and regrowth. This results in deformity of the affected bones.,"The cause of Paget disease is unknown. It may be due to genetic factors, but also could be due to a viral infection early in life or hypersensitivity to vitamin D. The disease occurs worldwide, but is more common in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The disease has become much less common over the last 50 years. In people with Paget disease, there is an abnormal breakdown of bone tissue in specific areas. This is followed by abnormal bone formation. The new area of bone is larger, but weaker. The new bone is also filled with new blood vessels. The affected bone may only be in one or two areas of the skeleton, or in many different bones in the body. It more often involves bones of the arms, collarbones, legs, pelvis, spine, and skull.","Most people with the condition have no symptoms.

Painful menstrual periods,"Painful menstrual periods are periods in which a woman has crampy lower abdominal pain, which can be sharp or aching and come and go. Back pain and/or leg pain may also be present.","Painful menstrual periods fall into two groups, depending on the cause: Primary dysmenorrhea Secondary dysmenorrhea Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs around the time that menstrual periods first begin in otherwise healthy young women. In most cases, this pain is not related to a specific problem with the uterus or other pelvic organs. Increased activity of the hormone prostaglandin, which is produced in the uterus, is thought to play a role in this condition. Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that develops later in women who have had normal periods. It is often related to problems in the uterus or other pelvic organs, such as: Endometriosis Fibroids Intrauterine device (IUD) made of copper Pelvic inflammatory disease Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Sexually transmitted infection Stress and anxiety",,"The following steps may help you to avoid prescription medicines: Apply a heating pad to your lower belly area, below your belly button. Never fall asleep with the heating pad on. Do light circular massage with your fingertips around your lower belly area. Drink warm beverages. Eat light, but frequent meals. Keep your legs raised while lying down or lie on your side with your knees bent. Practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga. Try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

Pancreas divisum,"Pancreas divisum is a birth defect in which parts of the pancreas do not join together. The pancreas is a long, flat organ located between the stomach and spine. It helps in food digestion.","Pancreas divisum is the most common birth defect of the pancreas. In many cases, this defect goes undetected and causes no problems. The cause of the defect is unknown. As a baby develops in the womb (uterus), two separate pieces of tissue join together to form the pancreas. Each part has a tube, called a duct. When the parts join together, a final duct, called the pancreatic duct, is formed. Fluid and digestive juices (enzymes) produced by the pancreas normally flow through this duct. Pancreas divisum occurs if the ducts do not join while the baby develops. Fluid from the two parts of the pancreas drains into separate areas of the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum). This occurs in 5% to 15% of people. If a pancreatic duct becomes blocked, swelling and tissue damage (pancreatitis) may develop.","Many people do not have any symptoms.

Pancreatic cancer,Pancreatic cancer is cancer that starts in the pancreas.,"The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach. It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels. There are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell in which the cancer develops. Examples include: Adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer Other more rare types include glucagonoma , insulinoma , islet cell tumor , VIPoma The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in people who: Are obese Have a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables Have diabetes Have long-term exposure to certain chemicals Have long-term inflammation of the pancreas ( chronic pancreatitis ) Smoke The risk for pancreatic cancer increases with age. Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer.","A tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: Diarrhea Dark urine and clay-colored stools Fatigue and weakness Sudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes) Jaundice (a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin Loss of appetite and weight loss Nausea and vomiting Pain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen",,Pancreatic cancer; Cancer - pancreas
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors,Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare tumors of the pancreas that start from a type of cell called the islet cell.,"In the healthy pancreas, cells called islet cells produce hormones that regulate several bodily functions. These include blood sugar level and the production of stomach acid. Tumors that arise from islet cells of the pancreas can also produce a variety of hormones, which can lead to specific symptoms. Pancreatic NETs can be noncancerous ( benign ) or cancerous ( malignant ). NETs include: Gastrinoma ( Zollinger-Ellison syndrome ) Glucagonoma Insulinoma Somatostatinoma VIPoma ( Verner-Morrison syndrome ) A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I ( MEN I ) is a risk factor for the development of NETs.","Symptoms depend on which hormone is made by the tumor. For example, insulinomas produce insulin, which lowers blood sugar level. Symptoms may include: Feeling tired or weak Shaking or sweating Headache Hunger Nervousness, anxiety, or feeling irritable Unclear thinking or feeling uneasy Double or blurry vision Fast or pounding heartbeat If your blood sugar level gets too low, you may faint, have a seizure, or even go into a coma. Gastrinomas make the hormone gastrin, which tells the body to make stomach acid. Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea Ulcers in the stomach and small bowel Vomiting blood (occasionally) Glucagonomas make the hormone glucagon, which helps the body raise blood sugar level. Symptoms can include: Diabetes Red, blistery rash in the groin or buttocks Weight loss Frequent urination and thirst Somatostatinomas make the hormone somatostatin. Symptoms may include: High blood sugar Gallstones Yellowish appearance to skin, and eyes Weight loss Diarrhea with foul smelling stools VIPomas make the hormone vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) which is involved in maintaining the balance of sodium, potassium and other minerals in the GI tract.

Pancreatitis - children,"Pancreatitis in children, as in adults, occurs when the pancreas becomes swollen and inflamed.","The pancreas is an organ behind the stomach. It produces chemicals called enzymes, which are needed to digest food. Most of the time, the enzymes are only active after they reach the small intestine. When these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding and damage to the organ and its blood vessels. This condition is called pancreatitis. Common causes of pancreatitis in children include: Trauma to the belly, such as from a bicycle handlebar injury Blocked bile duct Side effects of medicine, such as anti-seizure medicines, chemotherapy, or some antibiotics Viral infections, including mumps and coxsackie B High blood levels of a fat in the blood, called triglycerides Other causes include: After an organ or bone marrow transplant Cystic fibrosis Crohn disease and other disorders, when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake Type 1 diabetes that is uncontrolled Overactive parathyroid gland causing very high calcium levels Kawasaki disease Sometimes, the cause is unknown.","The main symptom of pancreatitis in children is severe pain in the upper abdomen.

The exact number of parainfluenza cases is unknown. The number is suspected to be very high. Infections are most common in fall and winter. Parainfluenza infections are most severe in infants and become less severe with age. By school age, most children have been exposed to the parainfluenza virus. Most adults have antibodies against parainfluenza, although they can get repeat infections.","Symptoms vary depending on the type of infection. Cold-like symptoms consisting of a runny nose and mild cough are common. Life-threatening respiratory symptoms can be seen in young infants with bronchiolitis and those with weak immune system. In general, symptoms may include: Sore throat Fever Runny or stuffy nose Chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing Cough or croup",,Human parainfluenza virus; HPIVs
Paranoid personality disorder,"Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of distrust and suspicion of others. The person does not have a full-blown psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.","Causes of PPD are unknown. PPD seems to be more common in families with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorder. This suggests genes may be involved. Other factors may play a role as well. PPD seems to be more common in men.","People with PPD are very suspicious of other people. As a result, they severely limit their social lives. They often feel that they are in danger and look for evidence to support their suspicions. They have trouble seeing that their distrust is out of proportion to their environment. Common symptoms include: Concern that other people have hidden motives Thinking that they will be exploited (used) or harmed by others Not able to work together with others Social isolation Detachment Hostility",,Personality disorder - paranoid; PPD
Paraphimosis,Paraphimosis occurs when the foreskin of an uncircumcised male cannot be pulled back over the head of the penis.,"Causes of paraphimosis include: Injury to the penis. Failure to return the foreskin to its normal location after urination or washing. This is more common in hospitals and nursing homes. Infection, which may be due to not washing the area well. Men who have not been circumcised and those who may not have been correctly circumcised are at risk. Paraphimosis occurs most often in boys and older men.",The foreskin is pulled back (retracted) behind the rounded tip of the penis (glans) and stays there. The retracted foreskin and glans become swollen. This makes it difficult to return the foreskin to its extended position. Symptoms include: Inability to pull the retracted foreskin forward over the head of the penis Painful swelling at the end of the penis Pain in the penis,,
Parapneumonic pleural effusion,Pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the layers of the tissue lining the lung and the chest cavity.,"Pneumonia, most commonly from bacteria, causes parapneumonic pleural effusion.","Symptoms can include any of the following: Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths Cough with sputum Fever Rapid breathing Shortness of breath",,Pleural effusion - pneumonia
Paraquat poisoning,"Paraquat (dipyridylium) is a highly toxic weed killer (herbicide). In the past, the United States encouraged Mexico to use it to destroy marijuana plants. Later, research showed this herbicide was dangerous to workers who applied it to the plants.","In the United States, paraquat is classified as ""restricted commercial use."" People must obtain a license to use the product. Breathing in paraquat may cause lung damage and can lead to a disease called paraquat lung. Paraquat causes damage to the body when it touches the lining of the mouth, stomach, or intestines. You can get sick if paraquat touches a cut on your skin. Paraquat may also damage the kidneys, liver, and esophagus (the tube that food goes down from your mouth to your stomach). If paraquat is swallowed, death can quickly occur. Death may occur from a hole in the esophagus, or from severe inflammation of the area that surrounds the major blood vessels and airways in the middle of the chest (mediastinum). Long-term exposure to paraquat may cause scarring of the lungs called pulmonary fibrosis. This makes it hard to breathe.","Symptoms of paraquat poisoning include: Burns and pain in the throat Choking Coma (lack of responsiveness) Difficulty breathing Nosebleed Seizures Shock (extremely low blood pressure) Shortness of breath Stomach pain Vomiting, including vomiting blood",,Paraquat lung
Parathyroid adenoma,"A parathyroid adenoma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.","The parathyroid glands in the neck help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones. Parathyroid adenomas are common. Most parathyroid adenomas do not have an identified cause. Sometimes a genetic problem is the cause. This is more common if the diagnosis is made when you are young. Parathyroid adenomas may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes: Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA Isolated familial hyperparathyroidism In people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family. You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition. In MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas. In MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland. Conditions that stimulate the parathyroid glands to get bigger can also cause an adenoma. These include: Genetic disorders Taking the medicine lithium Chronic kidney disease Women over age 60 have the highest risk for developing this condition. Radiation to the head or neck also increases the risk.","Many people have no symptoms. The condition is often discovered when blood tests are done for another medical reason. Parathyroid adenomas are the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), which leads to an increased blood calcium level. Symptoms may include any of the following: Confusion Constipation Lack of energy ( lethargy ) Muscle pain Nausea or decreased appetite Urinating more often at night Weak bones or fractures",,Hyperparathyroidism - parathyroid adenoma; Overactive parathyroid gland - parathyroid adenoma; Osteoporosis - parathyroid adenoma; Bone thinning - parathyroid adenoma; Osteopenia - parathyroid adenoma; High calcium level - parathyroid adenoma; Chronic kidney disease - parathyroid adenoma; Kidney failure - parathyroid adenoma
Parathyroid cancer,Parathyroid cancer is a cancerous (malignant) growth in a parathyroid gland.,"The parathyroid glands control the calcium level in the body. There are 4 parathyroid glands, 2 on top of each lobe of the thyroid gland, which is located at the base of the neck. Parathyroid cancer is a very rare type of cancer. It affects men and women equally. The cancer often occurs in people older than 30. The cause of parathyroid cancer is unknown. People with a genetic conditions called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome have an increased risk for this disease. People who had head or neck radiation also may be at increased risk. But this type of radiation is more likely to cause thyroid cancer.","Symptoms of parathyroid cancer are mainly caused by a high level of calcium in the blood ( hypercalcemia ), and may affect different parts of the body. Symptoms include: Bone pain Constipation Fatigue Fractures Frequent thirst Frequent urination Kidney stones Muscle weakness Nausea and vomiting Poor appetite",,Parathyroid carcinoma

It occurs with swollen lymph nodes and an illness with a fever.","Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (POS) is caused by an infection with bacteria, a virus, fungus, or parasite. The most common causes are cat scratch disease and tularemia (rabbit fever). The bacteria that cause either condition can infect the eye. The bacteria can directly enter the eye (on a finger or other object), or air droplets that carry the bacteria can land on the eye. Other infectious diseases may spread the same way, or through the bloodstream to the eye.","Symptoms include: Red, irritated, and painful eye (looks like ""pink eye"") Fever General ill feeling Increased tearing (possible) Swelling of nearby lymph glands (often in front of the ear)",,Cat scratch disease; Oculoglandular syndrome
Parkinson disease,Parkinson disease results from certain brain cells dying. These cells help control movement and coordination. The disease leads to shaking (tremors) and trouble walking and moving.,"Nerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make dopamine slowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away. Parkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults. The disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families. The disease can occur in younger adults. In such cases, it is often due to the person's genes. Parkinson disease is rare in children. Watch this video about: Parkinson disease","Symptoms may be mild at first. For instance, you may have a mild tremor or a slight feeling that one leg is stiff and dragging. Jaw tremor has also been an early sign of Parkinson disease. Symptoms may affect one or both sides of the body. General symptoms may include: Problems with balance and walking Rigid or stiff muscles Muscle aches and pains Low blood pressure when you stand up ( orthostatic hypotension ) Stooped posture Constipation Sweating and not being able to control your body temperature Slow or infrequent blinking Difficulty swallowing Drooling Slowed, quieter speech and monotone voice No expression in your face (like you are wearing a mask) Unable to write clearly or handwriting is very small (micrographia) Movement problems may include: Difficulty starting movement, such as starting to walk or getting out of a chair Difficulty continuing to move Slowed movements Loss of fine hand movements (writing may become small and difficult to read) Difficulty eating Symptoms of shaking (tremors): Usually occur when your limbs are not moving. This is called resting tremor. May occur when your arm or leg is held out. Go away when you move. May be worse when you are tired, excited, or stressed. Can cause you to rub your finger and thumb together without meaning to (called pill-rolling tremor). Eventually may occur in your head, lips, tongue, and feet. Other symptoms may include: Anxiety, stress, and tension Cognitive changes Confusion Depression Disturbed sleep Fainting Low blood pressure Memory loss",,Paralysis agitans; Shaking palsy; Parkinson's disease

Paronychia,Paronychia is a skin infection that occurs around the nails.,"Paronychia is common. It is from injury to the area, such as biting off or picking a hangnail or from trimming or pushing back the cuticle. The infection is caused by: Bacteria Candida, a type of yeast Other types of fungi A bacterial and fungal infection can occur at the same time. Fungal paronychia may occur in people who: Have a fungal nail infection Have diabetes Expose their hands to water a lot","The main symptom is a painful, red, swollen area around the nail, often at the cuticle or at the site of a hangnail or other injury. There may be pus-filled blisters , especially with a bacterial infection. Bacteria cause the condition to come on suddenly. If all or part of the infection is due to a fungus, it tends to occur more slowly. Nail changes may occur. For example, the nail may look detached, abnormally shaped, or have an unusual color. If the infection spreads to the rest of the body, symptoms may include: Fever, chills Development of red streaks along the skin General ill feeling Joint pain Muscle pain",,Infection - skin around the nail
Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH),Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a rare blood disorder in which the body's immune system produces antibodies that destroy red blood cells. It occurs when the person is exposed to cold temperatures.,"PCH only occurs in the cold, and affects mainly the hands and feet. Antibodies attach (bind) to red blood cells. This allows other proteins in the blood (called complement) to also latch on. The antibodies destroy the red blood cells as they move through the body. As the cells are destroyed, hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen, is released into the blood and passed in the urine. PCH has been linked to secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and other viral or bacterial infections. Sometimes the cause is unknown. The disorder is rare.","Symptoms may include: Chills Fever Back pain Leg pain Abdominal pain Headache General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling ( malaise ) Blood in the urine (red urine)",,PCH
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare disease in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal.,"People with this disease have blood cells that are missing a gene called PIG-A. This gene allows a substance called glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) to help certain proteins stick to cells. Without PIG-A, important proteins cannot connect to the cell surface and protect the cell from substances in the blood called complement. As a result, red blood cells break down too early. The red cells leak hemoglobin into the blood, which can pass into the urine. This can happen at any time, but is more likely to occur during the night or early morning. The disease can affect people of any age. It may be associated with aplastic anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , or acute myelogenous leukemia . Risk factors, except for prior aplastic anemia, are not known.","Symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Back pain Blood clots , may form in some people Dark urine, comes and goes Easy bruising or bleeding Headache Shortness of breath Weakness, fatigue Pallor Chest pain Difficulty swallowing",,PNH
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT),"Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is episodes of a rapid heart rate that start in a part of the heart above the ventricles. ""Paroxysmal"" means from time to time.","Normally, the chambers of the heart (atria and ventricles) contract in a coordinated manner. The contractions are caused by an electrical signal that begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). The signal moves through the upper heart chambers (the atria) and tells the atria to contract. After this, the signal moves down in the heart and tells the lower chambers (the ventricles) to contract. The rapid heart rate from PSVT may start with events that occur in areas of the heart above the lower chambers (ventricles). There are a number of specific causes of PSVT. It can develop when doses of the heart medicine, digitalis, are too high. It can also occur with a condition known as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome , which often causes symptoms in young people and infants. The following increase your risk for PSVT: Alcohol use Caffeine use Illicit stimulant drug use Smoking","Symptoms most often start and stop suddenly. They can last for a few minutes or several hours. Symptoms may include: Anxiety Chest tightness Palpitations (a sensation of feeling the heartbeat), often with an irregular or fast rate (racing) Rapid pulse Shortness of breath Other symptoms that can occur with this condition include: Dizziness Fainting",,PSVT; Supraventricular tachycardia; Abnormal heart rhythm - PSVT; Arrhythmia - PSVT; Rapid heart rate - PSVT; Fast heart rate - PSVT
Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome,"Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is when a person who has one X and one Y chromosome (typically seen in males) but is resistant to hormones that produce a male appearance (called androgens). As a result, the person has some of the physical traits of a female, but the genetic makeup of a male.","In the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy, all babies have the same genitals. As a baby grows inside the womb, male or female genitals develop depending on the pair of sex chromosomes the baby has from the parents (XY for male, XX for female). It also depends on the levels of androgens. In a baby with XY chromosomes, high levels of androgens are made in the testes. This baby will develop male genitals. In a baby with XX chromosomes, there are no testes and the levels of androgens are very low. This baby will develop female genitals. PAIS is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body less able to respond to androgens. This leads to problems with the development of the male sex organs. At birth, the baby may have ambiguous external genitals . This means that they do not look typically either male or female. The syndrome is passed down genetically ( X-linked recessive inheritance ). People with two X chromosomes are not affected if only one copy of the X chromosome carries the genetic variant. Males who inherit the gene from their mothers will have the condition. There is a 50% chance that a male child of a mother with the genetic trait will be affected. Every female child of a mother with the genetic trait has a 50% chance of carrying the genetic trait. Family history is important in determining risk factors of PAIS.","People with PAIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. These characteristics vary from person to person. These may include: Inguinal hernia . Male breast development at the time of puberty. ( gynecomastia ) Testes in the abdomen or other atypical places in the body ( undescended testicles ). A very small penis (micropenis). The opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis, not the tip ( hypospadias ). Scrotum that is split in two (bifid scrotum).

You may use medicated creams that bleach or lighten the skin to reduce discoloration or to even the skin tone where hyperpigmented areas are large or very noticeable. Check with your health care provider first about using such products. Follow the instructions on the package about how to use such products. Selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue), ketoconazole, or tolnaftate (Tinactin) lotion can help treat tinea versicolor , which is a fungal infection that can appear as hypopigmented patches. Apply as directed to the affected area daily until the discolored patches disappear. Tinea versicolor often returns, even with treatment. You may use cosmetics or skin dyes to hide skin color changes. Makeup can also help hide mottled skin, but it will not cure the problem.

Patent foramen ovale,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a hole between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart. This hole exists in everyone before birth, but most often closes shortly after being born. PFO is what the hole is called when it fails to close naturally after a baby is born.","A foramen ovale allows blood to go around the lungs. A baby's lungs are not used when it grows in the womb, so the hole does not cause problems in an unborn infant. The opening is supposed to close soon after birth, but sometimes it does not. In about 1 out of 4 people, the opening never closes. If it does not close, it is called a PFO. The cause of a PFO is unknown.

Pediatric sleep apnea,"With pediatric sleep apnea, a child's breathing pauses during sleep because the airway has become narrowed or partly blocked.","During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs. Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea. Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include: A small jaw Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate) Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway Obesity Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy","Loud snoring is a telltale symptom of sleep apnea. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. However, not every child who snores has sleep apnea. Children with sleep apnea also have the following symptoms at night: Long silent pauses in breathing followed by snorts, choking, and gasps for air Breathing mainly though the mouth Restless sleep Waking up often Sleepwalking Sweating Bedwetting During the daytime, children with sleep apnea may: Feel sleepy or drowsy throughout the day Act grumpy, impatient, or irritable Have trouble concentrating in school Have hyperactive behavior",,Sleep apnea - pediatric; Apnea - pediatric sleep apnea syndrome; Sleep-disordered breathing - pediatric

The disease is more common in parts of the world (such as certain parts of Africa) where people have a lot of untreated corn in their diet. Corn is a poor source of tryptophan, and niacin in corn is tightly bound to other components of the grain. Niacin is released from corn if soaked in limewater overnight. This method is used to cook tortillas in Central America where pellagra is rare.

Other symptoms may include: Ankle, feet, and leg swelling Anxiety Breathing difficulty when lying down Dry cough Fatigue",,
Pericarditis - after heart attack,Pericarditis is inflammation and swelling of the covering of the heart (pericardium). It can occur in the days or weeks following a heart attack.,"Two types of pericarditis can occur after a heart attack. Early pericarditis: This form most often occurs within 1 to 3 days after a heart attack. Inflammation and swelling develop as the body tries to clean up the damaged heart tissue. Late pericarditis: This is also called Dressler syndrome. It is also called post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis. It most often develops several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. It can also happen about a week after a heart injury. Dressler syndrome is thought to occur when the immune system attacks healthy heart tissue by mistake. Things that put you at higher risk for pericarditis include: A previous heart attack Open heart surgery Chest trauma A heart attack that has affected the full thickness of your heart muscle","Symptoms include: Anxiety Chest pain from the swollen pericardium rubbing on the heart. The pain may be sharp, tight or crushing and may move to the neck, shoulder, or abdomen. The pain may also be worse when you breathe and go away when you lean forward, stand, or sit up. Trouble breathing Dry cough Fast heart rate (tachycardia) Fatigue Fever (common with the second type of pericarditis) Malaise (general ill feeling) Splinting of ribs (bending over or holding the chest) with deep breathing",,Dressler syndrome; Post-MI pericarditis; Post-cardiac injury syndrome; Postcardiotomy pericarditis
Pericarditis - constrictive,Constrictive pericarditis is a process in which the sac-like covering of the heart (the pericardium) becomes thickened and scarred.,"Most of the time, constrictive pericarditis occurs due to things that cause inflammation to develop around the heart, such as: Heart surgery Radiation therapy to the chest Tuberculosis Less common causes include: Abnormal fluid buildup in the covering of the heart. This may occur because of infection or as a complication of surgery. Mesothelioma The condition may also develop without a clear cause. It is rare in children.","When you have constrictive pericarditis, the inflammation causes the covering of the heart to become thick and rigid. This makes it hard for the heart to expand properly when it beats. As a result, the heart chambers don't fill up with enough blood. Blood backs up behind the heart, causing heart swelling and other symptoms of heart failure. Symptoms of chronic constrictive pericarditis include: Difficulty breathing ( dyspnea ) that develops slowly and gets worse Fatigue Long-term swelling ( edema ) of the legs and ankles Swollen abdomen Weakness",,Constrictive pericarditis
Perichondritis,Perichondritis is an infection of the skin and tissue surrounding the cartilage of the outer ear.,"Cartilage is the thick tissue that creates the shape of the nose and the outer ear. All cartilage has a thin layer of tissue around it called the perichondrium. This covering helps provide nutrients to the cartilage. The most common type of bacteria that causes perichondritis infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Perichondritis is usually caused by an injury to the ear due to: Ear surgery Ear piercing (especially piercing of the cartilage) Contact sports Trauma to the side of the head Ear piercing through the cartilage is probably the major risk factor today. Surgery, burns, and acupuncture also increase the risk for infection. Perichondritis can lead to chondritis, which is an infection of the cartilage itself. This can cause severe damage to the ear structure.","A painful, swollen, red ear is the most common symptom. At first, the infection will look like a skin infection, but it quickly worsens and involves the perichondrium. The redness usually surrounds an area of injury, such as a cut or scrape. There may also be fever. In more severe cases, fluid will drain from the wound.",,
Periodontitis,Periodontitis is inflammation and infection of the ligaments and bones that support the teeth.,"Periodontitis is a chronic infection of the gums that occurs when gum inflammation ( gingivitis ) is not treated. The infection worsens over time, causing breakdown and loss of the ligaments, soft tissues, and bone (supporting structures) of your teeth. This loss of support causes the teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. Periodontitis is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. This disorder is uncommon in young children, but it increases during the teen years. Plaque and tartar build up on the teeth. Inflammation results from this buildup and causes a normal “sulcus” to deepen into an abnormal ""pocket,"" or gap between the gums and the teeth below the gum line. This pocket collects more plaque and transforms into a hard material called tartar. The bacteria in the plaque and tartar get trapped in the pockets and receive less oxygen. These anaerobes trigger the body’s inflammatory response, which leads to the natural destruction of the support for your teeth. Periodontal disease is a painless, chronic inflammatory disease, which if not treated, often leads to tooth mobility and tooth loss","Symptoms of periodontitis include: Bad breath odor (halitosis) Gums that are bright red or reddish-purple Gums that look shiny Gums that bleed easily (when flossing or brushing) Gums that are tender when touched but are painless otherwise Gums that have receded Loose teeth Swollen gums Gaps between the teeth and gums Shifting teeth Yellow, brown green or white hard deposits on your teeth Tooth sensitivity Note: Early symptoms are similar to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums).",,Pyorrhea - gum disease; Inflammation of gums - involving bone

Periorbital cellulitis,Periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.,"Periorbital cellulitis can occur at any age, but more commonly affects children younger than 5 years old. This infection can occur after a scratch, injury, or bug bite around the eye, which allows germs to enter the wound. It can also extend from a nearby site that is infected, such as the sinuses. Periorbital cellulitis is different than orbital cellulitis , which is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye. In contrast to periorbital cellulitis, orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems and deeper infections.","Symptoms include: Redness around the eye or in the white part of the eye Swelling of the eyelid, whites of eyes, and surrounding area This condition usually does not affect vision or cause eye pain.",,Preseptal cellulitis
Periosteum,The periosteum is a fibrous sheath that covers bones. It contains the blood vessels and nerves that provide nourishment and sensation to the bone.

Peripheral artery disease - legs,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition of the blood vessels that supply the legs and feet. It occurs due to narrowing of the arteries in the legs. This causes decreased blood flow, which can injure skin, muscles, nerves and other tissues.","PAD is commonly caused by atherosclerosis . This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries and makes them narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed. As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting. PAD is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well. People are at higher risk if they have a history of: Abnormal blood cholesterol level Diabetes Heart disease (coronary artery disease) High blood pressure ( hypertension ) Kidney disease involving hemodialysis Smoking Stroke ( cerebrovascular disease )","The main symptoms of PAD are pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. These symptoms most often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest.

Other health conditions that may cause neuropathy are: Autoimmune disorders , such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus Chronic kidney disease Infections such as HIV/AIDS , shingles , and hepatitis C Low levels of vitamin B1, B6, B12, or other vitamins Metabolic disease Poisoning due to heavy metals, such as lead Poor blood flow to the legs Underactive thyroid gland Bone marrow disorders Tumors Certain inherited disorders Other things that can lead to nerve damage are: Trauma or pressure on a nerve Long-term, heavy alcohol use Glue, lead, mercury, and solvent poisoning Medicines that treat infections, cancer , seizures , and high blood pressure Pressure on a nerve, such as from carpal tunnel syndrome Being exposed to cold temperatures for a long period of time Pressure from bad-fitting casts, splints , a brace, or crutches","Symptoms depend on which nerve is damaged, and whether the damage affects one nerve, several nerves, or the whole body. PAIN AND NUMBNESS Tingling or burning in the arms and legs may be an early sign of nerve damage. These feelings often start in your toes and feet. You may have deep pain. This often happens in the feet and legs. You may lose feeling in your legs and arms. Because of this, you may not notice when you step on something sharp. You may not notice when you touch something that is too hot or cold, like the water in a bathtub. You may not know when you have a small blister or sore on your feet. Numbness may make it harder to tell where your feet are moving and can cause a loss of balance. MUSCLE PROBLEMS Damage to the nerves can make it harder to control muscles. It can also cause weakness. You may notice problems moving a part of your body. You may fall because your legs buckle. You may trip over your toes. Doing tasks such as buttoning a shirt may be harder. You may also notice that your muscles twitch or cramp. Your muscles may become smaller. PROBLEMS WITH BODY ORGANS People with nerve damage may have problems digesting food.

Perirenal abscess,Perirenal abscess is a pocket of pus around one or both kidneys. It is caused by an infection.,"Most perirenal abscesses are caused by a urinary tract infection that starts in the bladder. It then spreads to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system or a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess. The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones , by blockage of urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannot kill the bacteria there. Stones are found in 20% to 60% of people with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include: Diabetes Having an abnormal urinary tract Trauma to the kidney IV (intravenous) drug use","Symptoms of perirenal abscess include: Chills Fever Pain in the flank (side of the abdomen) or abdomen , which may extend to the groin or down the leg Sweating",,Perinephric abscess

One type is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). It occurs in people with ascites . Ascites is the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs. This problem is found in people with long-term liver damage, certain cancers, and heart failure. Peritonitis may be a result of other problems. This is known as secondary peritonitis . Problems that may lead to this type of peritonitis include: Trauma or wounds to the belly Ruptured appendix Ruptured diverticula Infection after any surgery in the belly",Your belly is very painful or tender. The pain may become worse when your belly is touched or when you move. Your belly may look or feel bloated. This is called abdominal distention .

Peritonitis - secondary,The peritoneum is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen. Peritonitis is present when this tissue becomes inflamed or infected. Secondary peritonitis is when another condition is the cause.,"Secondary peritonitis has several major causes. Bacteria may enter the peritoneum through a hole (perforation) in an organ of the digestive tract. The hole may be caused by a ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer, or perforated colon. It may also come from an injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound or following the ingestion of a sharp foreign body. Bile or chemicals released by the pancreas may leak into the abdominal cavity. This may be caused by swelling and inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis. Tubes or catheters placed into the abdomen may cause this problem. These include catheters for peritoneal dialysis, feeding tubes, and others. An infection of the bloodstream (sepsis) may lead to an infection in the abdomen also. This is a severe illness. This tissue may become infected when there is no clear cause. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and can lead to peritonitis. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or born early.",Symptoms include: Swollen abdomen when your belly area is bigger than usual Abdominal pain Decreased appetite Fever Low urine output Nausea Thirst Vomiting Note: There may be signs of shock .,,Secondary peritonitis
Peritonitis - spontaneous bacterial,The peritoneum is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen. Peritonitis is present when this tissue becomes inflamed or infected.,SBP is most often caused by infection in fluid that collects in the peritoneal cavity ( ascites ). The fluid buildup often occurs in people with advanced liver or kidney disease. Risk factors for liver disease include: Very heavy alcohol use Chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C Other diseases that lead to cirrhosis SBP also occurs in people who are on peritoneal dialysis for kidney failure. Peritonitis may have other causes in which case it is called secondary peritonitis.

Periventricular leukomalacia,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a type of brain injury that affects premature infants. The condition involves the death of small areas of brain tissue around fluid-filled areas called ventricles. The damage creates ""holes"" in the brain. ""Leuko"" refers to the brain's white matter. ""Periventricular"" refers to the area around the ventricles.","PVL is much more common in premature infants than in full-term infants. A major cause is thought to be changes in blood flow to the area around the ventricles of the brain. This area is fragile and prone to injury, especially before 32 weeks of gestation. Infection around the time of delivery may also play a role in causing PVL. The risk for PVL is higher for babies who are more premature and more unstable at birth. Premature babies who have intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are also at increased risk for developing this condition.",,,PVL; Brain injury - infants; Encephalopathy of prematurity
Pernicious anemia,Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.,"Pernicious anemia is a type of vitamin B12 anemia. The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. You get this vitamin from eating foods such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. A special protein, called intrinsic factor (IF), binds vitamin B12 so that it can be absorbed in the intestines. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Common causes of pernicious anemia include: Weakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis) An autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the actual intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of your stomach that make it. In rare cases, pernicious anemia is passed down through families. This is called congenital pernicious anemia. Babies with this type of anemia do not make enough intrinsic factor. Or they cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the small intestine. In adults, symptoms of pernicious anemia are usually not seen until after age 30. The average age of diagnosis is age 60. You are more likely to develop this disease if you: Are Scandinavian or Northern European Have a family history of the condition Certain diseases can also raise your risk. They include: Addison disease Graves disease Hypoparathyroidism Hypothyroidism Myasthenia gravis Loss of normal function of ovaries before 40 years of age (primary ovarian failure) Type 1 diabetes Testicular dysfunction Vitiligo Sjögren syndrome Hashimoto disease Celiac disease Pernicious anemia can also occur after gastric bypass surgery.","Some people do not have symptoms.

Phenylketonuria,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare condition in which a baby is born without the ability to properly break down an amino acid called phenylalanine.,"PKU is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. Babies with PKU are missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is needed to break down the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is found in foods that contain protein. Without the enzyme, levels of phenylalanine build up in the body. This buildup can harm the central nervous system and cause brain damage.","Phenylalanine plays a role in the body's production of melanin. The pigment is responsible for skin and hair color. Therefore, infants with the condition often have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than brothers or sisters without the disease. Other symptoms may include: Delayed mental and social skills Head size much smaller than normal Hyperactivity Jerking movements of the arms or legs Mental disability Seizures Skin rashes Tremors If PKU is untreated, or if foods containing phenylalanine are eaten, the breath, skin, ear wax, and urine may have a ""mousy"" or ""musty"" odor.

The larger the tumor, the higher the risk for future pituitary apoplexy. When pituitary bleeding occurs in a woman during or right after childbirth, it is called Sheehan syndrome . This is a very rare condition. Risk factors for pituitary apoplexy in non-pregnant people without a tumor include: Bleeding disorders Diabetes Head injury Radiation to the pituitary gland Use of a breathing machine Pituitary apoplexy in these situations is very rare.","Pituitary apoplexy usually has a short period of symptoms (acute), which can be life threatening. Symptoms often include: Severe headache (worst of your life) Paralysis of the eye muscles, causing double vision ( ophthalmoplegia ) or problems opening an eyelid Loss of peripheral vision or loss of all vision in one or both eyes Low blood pressure, nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting from acute adrenal insufficiency Personality changes due to sudden narrowing or spasm of one of the arteries in the brain (anterior cerebral artery) Less commonly, pituitary dysfunction may appear more slowly. In Sheehan syndrome, for example, the first symptom may be a failure to produce milk caused by a lack of the hormone prolactin after delivery. Over time, problems with other pituitary hormones may develop, causing symptoms of the following conditions: Growth hormone deficiency Adrenal insufficiency (if not already present or treated) Hypogonadism (body's sex glands produce little or no hormones) Hypothyroidism (thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone) In rare cases, when the posterior (back part) of the pituitary is involved, symptoms may include: Failure of the uterus to contract to give birth to a baby (in women) Failure to produce breast milk (in women) Frequent urination and severe thirst ( diabetes insipidus )",,Pituitary infarction; Pituitary tumor apoplexy
Pituitary tumor,A pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It regulates the body's balance of many hormones.,"Most pituitary tumors are noncancerous ( benign ). Up to 10% to 20% of people have pituitary tumors. Many of these tumors do not cause symptoms and are never diagnosed during the person's lifetime. The pituitary is part of the endocrine system. The pituitary helps control the release of hormones from other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid, sex glands (testes or ovaries), and adrenal glands . The pituitary also releases hormones that directly affect body tissues, such as bones and the breast milk glands. The pituitary hormones include: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Growth hormone (GH) Prolactin Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Watch this video about: Pituitary gland As a pituitary tumor grows, the normal hormone-releasing cells of the pituitary may be damaged. This results in the pituitary gland not producing enough of its hormones. This condition is called hypopituitarism . The causes of pituitary tumors are unknown. Some tumors are caused by hereditary disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I). The pituitary gland can be affected by other brain tumors that develop in the same part of the brain (skull base), resulting in similar symptoms.","Some pituitary tumors produce too much of one or more hormones. As a result, symptoms of one or more of the following conditions can occur: Hyperthyroidism (thyroid gland makes too much of its hormones; this is an extremely rare condition of pituitary tumors) Cushing syndrome (body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol) Gigantism (abnormal growth due to higher than normal level of growth hormone during childhood) or acromegaly (higher than normal level of growth hormone in adults) Nipple discharge and irregular or absent menstrual periods in women due to excess of the hormone prolactin Decreased sexual function in men due to excess of the hormone prolactin Symptoms caused by pressure from a larger pituitary tumor may include: Changes in vision such as double vision, visual field loss (loss of peripheral vision), drooping eyelids or changes in color vision. Headache. Lack of energy. Nasal drainage of clear, salty fluid. Nausea and vomiting. Problems with the sense of smell. In rare cases, these symptoms occur suddenly and can be severe ( pituitary apoplexy ).",,Tumor - pituitary; Pituitary adenoma
Pityriasis alba,Pityriasis alba is a common skin disorder that causes patches of light-colored (hypopigmented) areas.,The cause is unknown but may be linked to atopic dermatitis (eczema). The disorder is most common in children and teens. It is more noticeable in children with dark skin.,"The problem areas on the skin (lesions) often start as slightly red and scaly patches that are round or oval. They usually appear on the face, upper arms, neck, and upper middle of the body. After these lesions go away, the patches turn light-colored (hypopigmented). The patches do not tan easily. Because of this, they may get red quickly in the sun. As the skin surrounding the patches darkens normally, the patches may become more visible.",,
Pityriasis rosea,Pityriasis rosea is a common type of skin rash most often seen in young adults.,"Pityriasis rosea is believed to be caused by a virus. It occurs most often in the fall and spring. Although pityriasis rosea may occur in more than one person in a household at a time, it is not thought to spread from one person to another. Females seem to be more affected than males.","Attacks most often last 4 to 8 weeks. Symptoms may disappear by 3 weeks or last as long as 12 weeks. The rash starts with a single large patch called a herald patch. After several days, more skin rashes will appear on the chest, back, arms, and legs. The skin rashes: Are often pink or pale red Are oval in shape May be scaly May follow lines in the skin or appear in a ""Christmas tree"" pattern May itch Other symptoms may include: Headache Fatigue Sore throat Mild fever",,Rash - pityriasis rosea; Papulosquamous - pityriasis rosea; Herald patch
Pityriasis rubra pilaris,Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare skin disorder that causes inflammation and scaling (exfoliation) of the skin.,"There are several subtypes of PRP.

One subtype is associated with HIV/AIDS .","PRP is a chronic skin condition in which orange or salmon-colored scaly patches with thick skin develop on the hands and feet. The scaly areas may cover much of the body. Small islands of normal skin (called islands of sparing) are seen within the areas of the scaly skin. The scaly areas may be itchy. There may be changes in the nails. PRP can be severe. Although it's not life threatening, PRP can greatly reduce quality of life and limit activities of daily living.",,PRP; Pityriasis pilaris; Lichen ruber acuminatus; Devergie disease
Placenta abruption - definition,"The placenta is the organ that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the baby during pregnancy. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta detaches from the wall of the womb (uterus) before delivery. The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding and painful uterine contractions. Blood and oxygen supply to the baby may also be adversely affected, leading to fetal distress. The cause is unknown, but high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, cocaine or alcohol use, injury to the mother, and having multiple pregnancies increase the risk for the condition. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and can range from bed rest to emergency C-section.",,,,
Placenta previa,Placenta previa is a problem of pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix.,"During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the womb stretches and grows. It is very common for the placenta to be low in the womb in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta moves to the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix is open for delivery. Sometimes, the placenta partly or completely covers the cervix. This is called a placenta previa. There are different forms of placenta previa: Marginal: The placenta is next to the cervix but does not cover the opening. Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening. Complete: The placenta covers all of the cervical opening. Placenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies. It is more common in women who have: An abnormally shaped uterus Had many pregnancies in the past Had multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets Scarring on the lining of the uterus due to a history of surgery, C-section, or abortion In vitro fertilization A history of placenta previa in a previous pregnancy Women who smoke, use cocaine, or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk.","The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden bleeding from the vagina . Some women also have cramps. The bleeding often starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester. Bleeding may be severe and life threatening. It may stop on its own but can start again days or weeks later. Labor sometimes starts within several days of the heavy bleeding. Sometimes, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts.",,Vaginal bleeding - placenta previa; Pregnancy - placenta previa
Placental insufficiency,"The placenta is the link between you and your baby. When the placenta does not work as well as it should, your baby can get less oxygen and nutrients from you. As a result, your baby may:","The placenta may not work well, either due to pregnancy problems or social habits. These may include: Diabetes Going past your due date High blood pressure during pregnancy (called preeclampsia ) Medical conditions that increase the mother's chances of blood clots Smoking Taking cocaine or other drugs Anemia Certain medicines can also increase the risk for placental insufficiency. In some cases, the placenta: May have an abnormal shape May not grow big enough (more likely if you are carrying twins or other multiples) Does not attach correctly to the surface of the womb Breaks away from the surface of the womb or bleeds prematurely","A woman with placental insufficiency usually does not have any symptoms. However, certain diseases, such as preeclampsia, which can be symptomatic, can cause placental insufficiency.",,Placental dysfunction; Uteroplacental vascular insufficiency; Oligohydramnios
Plague,"Plague is a severe bacterial infection that may cause death. The disease affects small mammals, mainly rodents, and humans.","Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis . Rodents, such as rats, carry the disease, which is spread by fleas. In the Middle Ages in Europe, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. These days, plague occurs sporadically but can be treated and usually cured if caught early. Plague can still be found on nearly all continents. Most human cases have occurred in Africa. Today, plague is rare in the United States. An average of about 7 cases occur every year. Plague was introduced in the 1900s by rats aboard steamships. It caused epidemics in many urban areas up until 1925. The disease spread to the rural rodent population in the Western United States. Now most cases of plague occur in rural areas primarily in these states: Northern New Mexico and Arizona, and southern Colorado California, southern Oregon, and western Nevada \ Wild animals affected by plague include: Squirrels Rats Prairie dogs Chipmunks Mice Voles Rabbits Marmots Animals that eat other animals can get the disease by eating infected prey. Domestic animals, such as dogs and cats can contract plague if they are bitten by fleas that carry the disease or eat small rodents such as mice. People can get plague in the following ways: Being bitten by a flea that carries the plague bacteria from an infected animal. Dogs and cats can also carry infected fleas into the home and spread the disease. Handling an infected animal and coming into contact with body fluid or tissue.  For example, hunters who skin and prepare an infected animal could become infected. Breathing in respiratory droplets from an infected human or animal. Plague lung infection is called pneumonic plague. When someone with pneumonic plague coughs, tiny droplets carrying the bacteria move through the air. Anyone who breathes in these particles may catch the disease. In the United States, there have been cases of owners becoming infected by their sick cat through respiratory droplets.","There are three types of plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is an infection of the lymph nodes. It is the most common type of plague in the United States. Flea bites are usually the cause. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, usually 2 to 8 days after exposure to the bacteria. Symptoms include: Fever and chills General ill feeling ( malaise ) Headache Muscle pain Seizures Smooth, painful lymph gland swelling called buboes that are commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often at the site of the infection (flea bite or animal scratch). Pain may start before the swelling appears Septicemic plague is an infection of the blood. It may occur from a flea bite or from handling an infected animal. It can also occur from untreated bubonic plague. Septicemic plague may cause death even before severe symptoms occur. Symptoms can include: Abdominal pain Bleeding due to blood clotting problems Diarrhea Fever Nausea, vomiting Extreme weakness Shock Bleeding into the skin and organs Tissue death (skin turns black and dies) on fingers, toes, and nose. Pneumonic plague is an infection of the lungs. This is the most serious form and is what can cause epidemics to occur. It can occur from inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected human or animal (cat). It is the only type that spreads between humans. Untreated bubonic or septicemic plague can also develop into pneumonic plague when bacteria spread to the lungs. Pneumonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, typically 1 to 3 days after exposure. Pneumonia develops rapidly and symptoms include: Severe cough Difficulty breathing and pain in the chest when breathing deeply Weakness Fever and chills Headache Frothy, bloody sputum Respiratory failure Shock Human-to-human transmission of plague has not occurred in the United States since 1925.",,Bubonic plague; Pneumonic plague; Septicemic plague

When this tissue becomes swollen or inflamed, it is called plantar fasciitis.","Swelling occurs when the thick band of tissue on the bottom of the foot (fascia) is overstretched or overused. This can be painful and make walking more difficult. You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you: Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches ) Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces Are obese or gain weight suddenly Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel) Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles Change your activity level Plantar fasciitis is seen in both men and women. It is one of the most common orthopedic foot complaints. Plantar fasciitis was commonly thought to be caused by a heel spur. However, research has found that this is not the case. On x-ray, heel spurs are seen in people with and without plantar fasciitis.","The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the bottom of the heel. The heel pain may be dull or sharp. The bottom of the foot may also ache or burn.

Pneumothorax - infants,Pneumothorax is the collection of air or gas in the space inside the chest around the lungs. This leads to lung collapse.,"A pneumothorax occurs when some of the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in a baby's lung become overinflated and burst. This causes air to leak into the space between the lung and chest wall (pleural space). The most common cause of pneumothorax is respiratory distress syndrome . This is a condition that occurs in babies who are born too early (premature). The baby's lungs lack the slippery substance (surfactant) that helps them stay open (inflated). Therefore, the tiny air sacs are not able to expand as easily. If the baby needs a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator), extra pressure on the baby's lungs, from the machine can sometimes burst the air sacs. Meconium aspiration syndrome is another cause of pneumothorax in newborns. Before or during birth, the baby may breathe in the first bowel movement, called meconium. This may obstruct the airways and cause breathing problems. Other causes include pneumonia (infection of the lung) or underdeveloped lung tissue. Less commonly, otherwise healthy infants can develop an air leak when they take the first few breaths after birth. This occurs because of the pressure needed to expand the lungs for the first time. There may be genetic factors which contribute to this problem.","Many infants with pneumothorax do not have symptoms.

Therefore, once a person has washed the oil off the skin, the rash does not often spread from person to person. The plant oils may remain for a long time on clothing, pets, tools, shoes, and other surfaces. Contact with these items can cause rashes in the future if they are not cleaned well. Smoke from burning these plants can cause the same reaction.","Symptoms include: Extreme itching Red, streaky, patchy rash where the plant touched the skin Red bumps, which may form large, weeping blisters The reaction can vary from mild to severe. In rare cases, the person with the rash needs to be treated in the hospital. The worst symptoms are often seen during days 4 to 7 after coming in contact with the plant. The rash may last for 1 to 3 weeks.",,
Poisoning - fish and shellfish,"This article describes a group of different conditions caused by eating contaminated fish and seafood. The most common of these are ciguatera poisoning, scombroid poisoning, and various shellfish poisonings.",,"The harmful substances that cause ciguatera, scombroid, and shellfish poisonings are heat stable, so no amount of cooking will prevent you from becoming poisoned if you eat contaminated fish. Symptoms depend on the specific type of poisoning. Ciguatera poisoning symptoms can occur 2 to 12 hours after eating the fish. They include: Abdominal cramps Diarrhea (severe and watery) Nausea and vomiting Shortly after these symptoms develop, you will start to have strange sensations, which may include: A feeling that your teeth are loose and about to fall out Confusing hot and cold temperatures (for instance, you will feel like an ice cube is burning you, while a match is freezing your skin) Headache (probably the most common symptom) Low heart rate and low blood pressure (in very severe cases) Metallic taste in the mouth These symptoms may get worse if you drink alcohol with your meal. Scombroid poisoning symptoms most often occur immediately after eating the fish. They may include: Breathing problems, including wheezing and chest tightness (in severe cases) Extremely red skin on the face and body Flushing Hives and itching Nausea and vomiting Peppery or bitter taste Below are other well-known types of seafood poisoning, and their symptoms. Paralytic shellfish poisoning: About 30 minutes after eating contaminated seafood, you may have numbness or tingling in your mouth. This sensation may spread down to your arms and legs. You may become very dizzy, have a headache, and, in some cases, your arms and legs may become temporarily paralyzed. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, although these symptoms are much less common. Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning: The symptoms are very similar to those of ciguatera poisoning. After eating contaminated clams or mussels, you may experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms will be followed soon after by strange sensations that may include numbness or tingling in your mouth, headache, dizziness, and hot and cold temperature reversal. Amnesic shellfish poisoning: This is a strange and rare form of poisoning that begins with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms are followed by short-term memory loss, and other less common nervous system symptoms.",Shellfish poisoning may be a medical emergency. A person with serious or sudden symptoms should immediately be taken to an emergency medical center right away. You may need to call the local emergency number (such as 911) or poison control for appropriate treatment information.,Fish poisoning; Dinoflagellate poisoning; Seafood contamination; Paralytic shellfish poisoning; Ciguatera poisoning

Polio,Polio is a viral disease that can affect nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis. The medical name for polio is poliomyelitis.,"Polio is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by: Direct person-to-person contact Contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth Contact with infected feces The virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and lymph system . The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 to 35 days (average 7 to 14 days). Most people do not develop symptoms. Risks factors include: Lack of immunization against polio Travel to an area that has had a polio outbreak As a result of a global vaccination campaign over the past 25 years, polio has largely been eliminated. The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated. For an updated list of these countries, visit the website: www.polioeradication.org .","There are four basic patterns of polio infection: Inapparent infection Abortive disease Nonparalytic Paralytic INAPPARENT INFECTION Most people infected with poliovirus have inapparent infections. They usually do not have symptoms. The only way to know if someone has the infection is by performing a blood test or other tests to find the virus in the stool or throat. ABORTIVE DISEASE People who have abortive disease develop symptoms about 1 to 2 weeks after getting infected with the virus. Symptoms may include: Fever for 2 to 3 days General discomfort or uneasiness ( malaise ) Headache Sore throat Vomiting Loss of appetite Belly pain These symptoms last up to 5 days and people recover completely. They have no signs of nervous system problems. NONPARALYTIC POLIO People with this form of polio have signs of abortive polio and their symptoms are more intense. Other symptoms may include: Stiff and sore muscles at the back of the neck, trunk, arms, and legs Urinary problems and constipation Changes in muscle reaction ( reflexes ) as the disease progresses PARALYTIC POLIO This form of polio develops in a small percentage of people who are infected with the polio virus. Symptoms include those of abortive and nonparalytic polio.

Polyarteritis nodosa,Polyarteritis nodosa is a serious inflammatory blood vessel disease. The small and medium-sized arteries become swollen and damaged.,Arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to organs and tissues. The cause of polyarteritis nodosa is unknown. The condition occurs when certain immune cells attack the affected arteries. The tissues that are fed by the affected arteries do not get the oxygen and nourishment they need. Damage occurs as a result. More adults than children get this disease. People with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C may develop this disease.,"Symptoms are caused by damage to affected organs. The skin, joints, muscles, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidneys, and nervous system are often affected. Symptoms include: Abdominal pain Decreased appetite Fatigue Fever Joint aches Muscle aches Unintentional weight loss Weakness If nerves are affected, you may have numbness, pain, burning, and weakness. Damage to the nervous system may cause strokes or seizures .",,Periarteritis nodosa; PAN; Systemic necrotizing vasculitis
Polychromatophilia,Polychromatophilia refers to how red blood cells look under a microscope when the cells are stained with special dyes. It means there is more staining than normal with certain dyes. The extra staining is due to an increased number of immature red blood cells (RBCs) called reticulocytes. These cells have a blue-colored center.,,,,
Polycystic kidney disease,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a kidney disorder passed down through families. In this disease, many cysts form in the kidneys, causing them to become enlarged.","PKD is passed down through families (inherited). The two inherited forms of PKD are autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive . People with PKD have many clusters of cysts in the kidneys. What exactly triggers the cysts to form is unknown. PKD is associated with the following conditions: Aortic aneurysms Brain aneurysms Cysts in the liver, pancreas, and testes Diverticula of the colon As many as half of people with PKD have cysts in the liver.",Symptoms of PKD may include any of the following: Abdominal pain or tenderness Blood in the urine Excessive urination at night (nocturia) Flank pain on one or both sides Drowsiness Joint pain Nail abnormalities,,Cysts - kidneys; Kidney - polycystic; Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; ADPKD
Polycystic ovary syndrome,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which a woman has increased levels of male hormones (androgens). Many problems occur as a result of this increase of hormones, including:","PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are: Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period. In many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid (cyst) around them. The affected ovary may be slightly enlarged. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance. Women with PCOS have cycles where ovulation does not occur every month which may contribute to infertility The other symptoms of this disorder are due to the high levels of male hormones. Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.","Symptoms of PCOS include changes in the menstrual cycle, such as: Not getting a period after you have had one or more normal ones during puberty ( secondary amenorrhea ) Irregular periods that may come and go, and be very light to very heavy Other symptoms of PCOS include: Extra body hair that grows on the chest, belly, face, and around the nipples Acne on the face, chest, or back Skin changes, such as dark or thick skin markings and creases around the armpits, groin, neck, and breasts The development of male characteristics is not typical of PCOS and may indicate another problem. The following changes may indicate another problem apart from PCOS: Thinning hair on the head at the temples, called male pattern baldness Enlargement of the clitoris Deepening of the voice Decrease in breast size",,Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease; PCOS
Polycythemia - newborn,Polycythemia can occur when there are too many red blood cells (RBCs) in an infant's blood.,"The percentage of RBCs in the infant's blood is called the ""hematocrit."" When this is greater than 65%, polycythemia is present. Polycythemia can result from conditions that develop before birth. These may include: Delay in clamping the umbilical cord Diabetes in the baby's birth mother Inherited diseases and genetic problems Too little oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia), such as from congenital heart or vascular abnormalities Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other) The extra RBCs can slow or block the flow of blood in the smallest blood vessels. This is called hyperviscosity. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain.",Symptoms may include: Extreme sleepiness Feeding problems Seizures,,Neonatal polycythemia; Hyperviscosity - newborn
Polycythemia vera,Polycythemia vera (PV) is a bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells. The red blood cells are the most affected blood cell type.,PV is a disorder of the bone marrow. It mainly causes too many red blood cells to be produced. The numbers of white blood cells and platelets may also be higher than normal. PV is a rare disorder that occurs more often in men than in women. It is not usually seen in people under age 40. The problem is often linked to a gene defect called JAK2V617F. The cause of this gene defect is unknown. This gene defect is not an inherited disorder.,"In people with PV, there are too many red blood cells in the blood. This results in thicker blood, which can't flow through small blood vessels normally, leading to symptoms such as: Trouble breathing when lying down Dizziness Feeling tired all the time Full feeling in the left upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen) Headache Itchiness , especially after a warm bath Red skin coloring, especially of the face Shortness of breath Symptoms of blood clots in veins near the skin surface (phlebitis) Vision problems Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Joint pain",,Primary polycythemia; Polycythemia rubra vera; P.

Porphyria,"Porphyrias are a group of rare inherited disorders. An important part of hemoglobin, called heme, is not made properly. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Heme is also found in myoglobin, a protein found in certain muscles.","Normally, the body makes heme in a multi-step process. Porphyrins are made during several steps of this process. People with porphyria are lacking certain enzymes needed for this process. This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body. There are many different forms of porphyria. The most common type is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Drugs, infection, alcohol, and hormones such as estrogen may trigger attacks of certain types of porphyria. Porphyria is inherited. This means the disorder is passed down through families.","Porphyria causes three major symptoms: Abdominal pain or cramping (only in some forms of the disease) Sensitivity to light that can cause rashes, blistering, and scarring of the skin (photodermatitis) Problems with the nervous system and muscles (seizures, mental disturbances, nerve damage) Attacks can occur suddenly. They often start with severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting and constipation. Being out in the sun can cause pain, sensations of heat, blistering, and skin redness and swelling.

It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection. It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, poststreptococcal GN is rarely a complication of these infections. Poststreptococcal GN causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the blood to create urine. The condition is not common today because infections that can lead to the disorder are treated with antibiotics. Risk factors include: Strep throat Streptococcal skin infections (such as impetigo )","Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased urine output Rust-colored urine Swelling (edema), general swelling, swelling of the abdomen, swelling of the face or eyes, swelling of the feet, ankles, hands Visible blood in the urine Joint pain Joint stiffness or swelling",,Glomerulonephritis - poststreptococcal; Postinfectious glomerulonephritis

Potter syndrome,Potter syndrome and Potter phenotype refers to a group of findings associated with a lack of amniotic fluid and kidney failure in an unborn infant.,"In Potter syndrome, the primary problem is kidney failure. The kidneys fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb. The kidneys normally produce the amniotic fluid (as urine) that surrounds the unborn baby. Potter phenotype refers to a typical facial appearance that occurs in a newborn when there is no amniotic fluid. The lack of amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios. Without amniotic fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus. The pressure of the uterine wall leads to an unusual facial appearance, including widely separated eyes. Potter phenotype may also lead to abnormal limbs, or limbs that are held in abnormal positions or contractures . Oligohydramnios also stops development of the lungs, so the lungs do not work properly at birth.","Symptoms include: Widely separated eyes with epicanthal folds , broad nasal bridge , low set ears , and receding chin Absence of urine output Difficulty breathing",,Potter phenotype; Potter's syndrome

Prader-Willi syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome is a disease that is present from birth (congenital). It affects many parts of the body. People with this condition feel hungry all the time and become obese. They also have poor muscle tone, reduced mental ability, and underdeveloped sex organs.","Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing gene on chromosome 15. Normally, parents each pass down a copy of this chromosome. The syndrome can occur in a couple of ways: The father's genes are missing on chromosome 15 There are variations with the father's genes on chromosome 15 There are two copies of the mother's chromosome 15 and none from the father These genetic changes occur randomly. People who have this syndrome usually do not have a family history of the condition.","Signs of Prader-Willi syndrome may be seen at birth. Newborns are often small and floppy with reduced muscle tone Male infants may have undescended testicles Other symptoms may include: Trouble feeding as an infant, with poor weight gain Almond-shaped eyes Delayed muscle and motor function development Narrowed head at the temples Rapid weight gain Short stature Slow mental development Very small hands and feet in comparison to the child's body Children have an intense craving for food. They will do almost anything to get food, including hoarding. This can result in rapid weight gain and morbid obesity. Morbid obesity may lead to: Type 2 diabetes High blood pressure Joint and lung problems",,
Precocious puberty,Puberty is the time when a person's sexual and physical characteristics mature. Precocious puberty is when these body changes happen earlier than normal.,"Puberty usually begins between ages 8 and 13 for girls and ages 9 and 14 for boys. The exact age a child enters puberty depends on a number of factors, including family history, nutrition, and sex. Most often there is no clear cause for precocious puberty. Some cases are due to changes in the brain, genetic problems or certain tumors that release hormones. These conditions include: Disorders of the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glands Tumor of the hypothalamus (hypothalamic hamartoma) Tumors that release a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)","In girls, precocious puberty is when any of the following develop before age 8: Armpit or pubic hair Beginning to grow faster Breasts First period (menstruation) Mature outer genitals In boys, precocious puberty is when any of the following develop before age 9: Armpit or pubic hair Growth of the testes and penis Facial hair, often first on the upper lip Muscle growth Voice change (deepening)",,Pubertas praecox
Preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia is high blood pressure and signs of liver or kidney damage that occur in women after the 20th week of pregnancy. While it is rare, preeclampsia also may occur in a woman after delivering her baby, most often within 48 hours. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.","The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown. It occurs in 3% to 7% of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to start in the placenta.

Some mothers may not know they have herpes sores inside the vagina. Some women have had herpes infections in the past, but are not aware of it, and may pass the virus to their baby. Herpes type 2 (genital herpes) is the most common cause of herpes infection in newborn babies. But herpes type 1 (oral herpes) can also occur.","Herpes may only appear as a skin infection. Small, fluid-filled blisters ( vesicles ) may appear. These blisters break, crust over, and finally heal. A mild scar may remain. Herpes infection may also spread throughout the body. This is called disseminated herpes. In this type, the herpes virus can affect many parts of the body. Herpes infection in the brain is called herpes encephalitis The liver, lungs, and kidneys may also be involved There may or may not be blisters on the skin Newborn infants with herpes that has spread to the brain or other parts of the body are often very sick. Symptoms include: Skin sores, fluid-filled blisters Bleeding easily Breathing difficulties such as rapid breathing and short periods without breathing, which can lead to nostril flaring, grunting, or blue appearance Yellow skin and whites of the eyes Weakness Low body temperature (hypothermia) Poor feeding Seizures, shock , or coma Herpes that is caught shortly after birth has symptoms similar to those of birth-acquired herpes.

This may range from before penetration to a point just after penetration. It may leave the couple feeling unsatisfied.,,
Premature infant,A premature infant is a baby born before 37 full weeks of gestation (more than 3 weeks before the due date).,"At birth, a baby is classified as one of the following: Premature (less than 37 weeks gestation) Full term (37 to 42 weeks gestation) Post term (born after 42 weeks gestation) If a woman goes into labor before 37 weeks, it is called preterm labor . Late preterm babies who are born between 35 and 37 weeks gestation may not look premature. They may not be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), but they are still at risk for more problems than full-term babies. Health conditions in the mother, such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, may contribute to preterm labor. Often, the cause of preterm labor is unknown. Some premature births are multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets. Different pregnancy-related problems increase the risk of preterm labor or early delivery: A weakened cervix that begins to open (dilate) early, also called cervical incompetence Birth defects of the uterus History of preterm delivery Infection (a urinary tract infection or infection of the amniotic membrane) Poor nutrition right before or during pregnancy Preeclampsia : high blood pressure and protein in the urine that develop after the 20th week of pregnancy Premature rupture of the membranes ( placenta previa ) Other factors that increase the risk for preterm labor and a premature delivery include: Age of the mother (mothers who are younger than 16 or older than 35) Being African American Lack of prenatal care Low socioeconomic status Use of tobacco, cocaine, or amphetamines",The infant may have trouble breathing and keeping a constant body temperature.,,Preterm infant; Preemie; Premie; Neonatal - premie; NICU - premie
Premature ovarian failure,Premature ovarian failure is reduced function of the ovaries (including decreased production of hormones). Ovarian failure that occurs before the age of 40 is considered premature ovarian failure.,"Premature ovarian failure may be caused by genetic factors such as chromosome abnormalities. It may also occur with certain autoimmune disorders that disrupt the normal function of the ovaries. Most often there is no obvious cause, although a family history of the condition may play a role. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also cause premature ovarian failure.","Women with premature ovarian failure may develop symptoms of menopause, which include: Hot flashes Irregular or absent periods Mood swings Night sweats Vaginal dryness This condition may also make it hard for a woman to become pregnant.",,Ovarian hypofunction; Ovarian insufficiency
Premenstrual breast changes,Premenstrual swelling and tenderness of both breasts often occurs during the second half of the menstrual cycle.,Hormone changes during the menstrual cycle may lead to breast swelling. More estrogen is made early in the cycle and it peaks just before mid-cycle. This causes the breast ducts to grow in size. The progesterone level peaks near the 21st day (in a 28-day cycle). This causes growth of the breast lobules (milk glands). Premenstrual breast swelling is often linked with: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Fibrocystic breast disease (benign breast changes) Premenstrual breast tenderness and swelling probably occur to some degree in nearly all women. More severe symptoms may occur in many women during their childbearing years. Symptoms may be less in women taking birth control pills. Risk factors may include: Family history High-fat diet Too much caffeine,,"Self-care tips: Eat a lower fat diet. Avoid caffeine (coffee, tea, and chocolate). Avoid salt 1 to 2 weeks before your period starts. Get moderate to vigorous exercise every day. Wear a well-fitting bra day and night to provide good breast support. You should practice breast awareness. Do check your breasts for changes at regular intervals. The effectiveness of vitamin E, vitamin B6, and herbal preparations such as evening primrose oil are somewhat controversial. This should be discussed with your health care provider.",Premenstrual tenderness and swelling of the breasts; Breast tenderness - premenstrual; Breast swelling - premenstrual
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition in which a woman has severe depression symptoms, irritability, and tension before menstruation. The symptoms of PMDD are more severe than those seen with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).",The causes of PMS and PMDD have not been found. Hormone changes that occur during a woman's menstrual cycle may play a role. PMDD affects a small number of women during the years when they are having menstrual periods. Many women with this condition have: Anxiety Severe depression Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) Other factors that may play a role include: Alcohol or substance abuse Thyroid disorders Being overweight Having a mother with a history of the disorder Lack of exercise,"The symptoms of PMDD are similar to those of PMS. However, they are very often more severe and debilitating. They also include at least one mood-related symptom. Symptoms occur during the week just before menstrual bleeding. They most often get better within a few days after the period starts. Here is a list of common PMDD symptoms: Lack of interest in daily activities and relationships Fatigue or low energy Sadness or hopelessness, possibly thoughts of suicide Anxiety Out of control feeling Food cravings or binge eating Mood swings sometimes with bouts of crying Panic attacks Irritability or anger that affects other people Bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and joint or muscle pain Problems sleeping Trouble concentrating",,PMDD; Severe PMS; Menstrual disorder - dysphoric
Premenstrual syndrome,Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a wide range of symptoms. The symptoms start during the second half of the menstrual cycle (14 or more days after the first day of your last menstrual period). These usually go away 1 to 2 days after the menstrual period starts.,"The exact cause of PMS is not known. Changes in brain hormone levels may play a role. However, this has not been proven. Women with PMS may also respond differently to these hormones. PMS may be related to social, cultural, biological, and psychological factors. Most women experience PMS symptoms during their childbearing years. PMS occurs more often in women: Between their late 20s and 40s Who have had at least one child With a personal or family history of major depression With a history of postpartum depression or an affective mood disorder The symptoms often get worse in late 30s and 40s as menopause approaches.","The most common symptoms of PMS include: Bloating or feeling gassy Breast tenderness Clumsiness Constipation or diarrhea Food cravings Headache Less tolerance for noises and lights Other symptoms include: Confusion, trouble concentrating, or forgetfulness Fatigue and feeling slow or sluggish Feelings of sadness, depression, or hopelessness Feelings of tension, anxiety, or edginess Irritable, hostile, or aggressive behavior, with outbursts of anger toward self or others Loss of sex drive (may increase in some women) Mood swings Poor judgment Poor self-image, feelings of guilt, or increased fears Sleep problems (sleeping too much or too little)",,PMS; Premenstrual dysphoric disorder; PMDD
Prerenal azotemia,Prerenal azotemia is an abnormally high level of nitrogen waste products in the blood.,"Prerenal azotemia is common, especially in older adults and in people who are in the hospital. The kidneys filter the blood. They also make urine to remove waste products. When the amount, or pressure, of blood flow through the kidney drops, filtering of the blood also drops. Or it may not occur at all. Waste products stay in the blood. Little or no urine is made, even though the kidney itself is working. When nitrogen waste products, such as creatinine and urea, build up in the body, the condition is called azotemia. These waste products act as poisons when they build up. They damage tissues and reduce the ability of the organs to function. Prerenal azotemia is the most common form of kidney failure in hospitalized people. Any condition that reduces blood flow to the kidney may cause it, including: Burns Conditions that allow fluid to escape from the bloodstream Long-term vomiting, diarrhea, or bleeding Heat exposure Decreased fluid intake ( dehydration ) Loss of blood volume Certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that treat heart failure or high blood pressure) and NSAIDs Conditions in which the heart cannot pump enough blood or pumps blood at a low volume also increase the risk for prerenal azotemia. These conditions include: Heart failure Shock ( septic shock ) It can also be caused by conditions that interrupt blood flow to the kidney, such as: Certain types of surgery Injury to the kidney Blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney ( renal artery occlusion )","Prerenal azotemia may have no symptoms. Or, symptoms of the causes of prerenal azotemia may be present.

Presbyopia,Presbyopia is a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to focus. This makes it hard to see objects up close.,"The lens of the eye needs to change shape to focus on objects that are close. The ability of the lens to change shape is because of the elasticity of the lens. This elasticity decreases slowly as people age. The result is a slow loss in the ability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. People most often begin to notice the condition at around age 45, when they realize that they need to hold reading materials farther away in order to focus on them. Presbyopia is a natural part of the aging process and it affects everyone.",Symptoms include: Decreased focusing ability for near objects Eyestrain Headache,,

Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem of the adrenal glands themselves. Most cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the adrenal gland. Secondary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem elsewhere in the body that causes the adrenal glands to release too much aldosterone. These problems can be with: Genes Diet Medical disorders such as with the heart, liver, kidneys, or high blood pressure The condition mostly affects people 30 to 50 years old and is a common cause of high blood pressure in middle age.","Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism have common symptoms, including: High blood pressure Low level of potassium in the blood Feeling tired all the time Headache Muscle weakness Numbness",,Conn syndrome; Mineralocorticoid excess

Prolactinoma,A prolactinoma is a noncancerous (benign) pituitary tumor that produces a hormone called prolactin. This results in too much prolactin in the blood.,Prolactin is a hormone that triggers the breasts to produce milk (lactation). Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary tumor (adenoma) that produces a hormone. It makes up about 30% of all pituitary adenomas. Almost all pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign). Prolactinoma may occur as part of an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). Prolactinomas occur most commonly in people under age 40. They are more common in women than in men and are rare in children. At least half of all prolactinomas are very small (less than 3/8 of an inch or 1 centimeter [cm] in diameter). These small tumors occur more often in women and are called microprolactinomas. Larger tumors are more common in men. They tend to occur at an older age. The tumor can grow to a large size before symptoms appear. Tumors larger than 3/8 inch (1 cm) in diameter are called macroprolactinomas. The tumor is often detected at an earlier stage in young women than in men because the high prolactin causes irregular menstrual periods.,"In women: Abnormal milk flow from the breast in a woman who is not pregnant or nursing ( galactorrhea ) Breast tenderness Decreased sexual interest (libido) Decreased peripheral vision Headache Infertility Stopping of menstruation not related to menopause , or irregular menstruation Vision changes In men: Decreased sexual interest (libido) Decreased peripheral vision Enlargement of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Headache Erection problems (impotence) Infertility Vision changes Symptoms caused by pressure from a larger tumor may include: Headache Lethargy Nasal drainage Nausea and vomiting Problems with the sense of smell Sinus pain or pressure Vision changes, such as double vision, drooping eyelids , or visual field loss There may be no symptoms, especially in older men.",,Adenoma - secreting; Prolactin - secreting adenoma of the pituitary

These include chlamydia and gonorrhea . Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are more likely to occur from: Certain sexual practices, such as having anal sex without wearing a condom Having many sexual partners In men over age 35 years, E coli and other common bacteria most often cause prostatitis. This type of prostatitis may begin in the: Epididymis, a small tube that sits on top of the testes. Urethra, the tube that carries urine from your bladder and out through the penis. Acute prostatitis may also be caused by problems with the urethra or prostate, such as: Blockage that reduces or prevents the flow of urine out of the bladder Foreskin of the penis that cannot be pulled back (phimosis) Injury to the area between the scrotum and anus (perineum) Urinary catheter , cystoscopy , or prostate biopsy (removing a piece of tissue to look for cancer) Men age 50 years or older who have an enlarged prostate have a higher risk for prostatitis.

Prothrombin deficiency,Prothrombin deficiency is a disorder caused by a lack of a protein in the blood called prothrombin. It leads to problems with blood clotting (coagulation). Prothrombin is also known as factor II (factor two).,"When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should. Prothrombin, or factor II, is one such coagulation factor. Prothrombin deficiency runs in families (inherited) and is very rare. Both parents must have the gene to pass the disorder on to their children. A family history of a bleeding disorder can be a risk factor. Prothrombin deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired prothrombin deficiency.

Proximal renal tubular acidosis,"Proximal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys don't properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called acidosis).","When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood will become too acidic. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells. The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Acidic substances in the body are neutralized by alkaline substances, mainly bicarbonate. Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type II RTA) occurs when bicarbonate is not properly reabsorbed by the kidney's filtering system. Type II RTA is less common than type I RTA. Type I is also called distal renal tubular acidosis . Type II most often occurs during infancy and may go away by itself. Causes of type II RTA include: Cystinosis (body is unable to break down the substance cysteine) Drugs such as ifosfamide (a chemotherapy drug), certain antibiotics that are no longer used much (tetracycline), or acetazolamide Fanconi syndrome , a disorder of the kidney tubes in which certain substances normally absorbed into the bloodstream by the kidneys are released into the urine instead Inherited fructose intolerance , a disorder in which there is a lack of the protein needed to break down the fruit sugar fructose Multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer Primary hyperparathyroidism , a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck produce too much parathyroid hormone Sjögren syndrome , an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed Wilson disease , an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues Vitamin D deficiency","Symptoms of proximal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following: Confusion or decreased alertness Dehydration Fatigue Increased breathing rate Osteomalacia (softening of the bones) Muscle pain Weakness Other symptoms can include: Decreased urine output Increased heart rate or irregular heartbeat Muscle cramps Pain in the bones, back, flank, or abdomen Skeletal deformities",,Renal tubular acidosis - proximal; Type II RTA; RTA - proximal; Renal tubular acidosis type II

Pseudohypoparathyroidism,Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a genetic disorder in which the body fails to respond to parathyroid hormone.,"The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for bone health. If you have PHP, your body produces the right amount of PTH, but is resistant to its effect. This causes low blood calcium levels and high blood phosphate levels. PHP is caused by abnormal genes. There are different types of PHP. All forms are rare and are usually diagnosed in childhood. Type 1a is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner . That means only one parent needs to pass you the variant gene for you to have the condition. It is also called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The condition causes short stature, round face, obesity, developmental delay, and short hand bones. Symptoms depend on whether you inherit the gene from your mother or father. Type 1b involves resistance to PTH only in the kidneys. Less is known about type 1b than type 1a. Calcium in the blood is low, but there are none of the other characteristic features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Type 2 also involves low blood calcium and high blood phosphate levels. People with this form do not have the physical traits common to people with Type 1a. The genetic abnormality that causes it is not known. It is different from Type 1b in how the kidney responds to high PTH levels.","Symptoms are related to a low level of calcium and include: Cataracts Dental problems Numbness Seizures Tetany (a collection of symptoms including muscle twitches and hand and foot cramps and muscle spasms) People with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy may have the following symptoms: Calcium deposits under the skin Dimples that can replace knuckles on affected fingers Round face and short neck Short hand bones, especially the bone below the 4th finger Short height",,Albright hereditary osteodystrophy; Types 1A and 1B pseudohypoparathyroidism; PHP
Pseudomembranous colitis,Pseudomembranous colitis refers to swelling or inflammation of the large intestine (colon) due to an overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile (C difficile) bacteria.,"The C difficile bacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotic medicines. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon. Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The medicines responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. Health care providers in the hospital may pass this bacteria from one patient to another. Pseudomembranous colitis is uncommon in children, and rare in infants. It is most often seen in people who are in the hospital. However, it is becoming more common in people who take antibiotics and are not in a hospital. Risk factors include: Older age Antibiotic use Use of medicines that weaken the immune system (such as chemotherapy medicines) Recent surgery History of pseudomembranous colitis History of ulcerative colitis , Crohn disease , and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness, silvery scales, and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red, well-defined patches of skin with flaky, silver-white scales. This is called plaque psoriasis.","Psoriasis is common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 10 and 35, or as people get older. Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people. Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the collections of scales. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat: Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections Dry air or dry skin Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, insect bites, and other skin rashes Some medicines, including antimalaria medicines, beta-blockers, and lithium Stress Too little sunlight Too much sunlight (sunburn) Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people with HIV/AIDS . Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis ( psoriatic arthritis ). In addition, people with psoriasis have an increased risk for fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disorders, such as heart disease and stroke.","Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back. The main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky plaques of skin. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, soles of the feet, and genitals. The skin may be: Itchy Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) Pink-red in color Raised and thick Other symptoms may include: Joint or tendon pain or aching Nail changes , including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, small pits in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath Severe dandruff on the scalp There are five main types of psoriasis: Erythrodermic -- The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. Guttate -- Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form is often linked to strep infections, especially in children. Inverse -- Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin rather than the more common areas of the elbows and knees. Plaque -- Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis.

People with PA/IVS may also have a poorly developed tricuspid valve. They may also have an underdeveloped or very thick right ventricle, and abnormal blood vessels feeding the heart. Less commonly, structures in the left ventricle, aortic valve, and right atrium are involved.","Symptoms most often occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days. Symptoms may include: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Fast breathing Fatigue Poor eating habits (babies may get tired while nursing or sweat during feedings) Shortness of breath",,Pulmonary atresia - intact ventricular septum; PA/IVS; Congenital heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Cyanotic heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Valve - disorder pulmonary atresia
Pulmonary edema,Pulmonary edema is an abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs. This buildup of fluid leads to shortness of breath.,"Pulmonary edema is often caused by congestive heart failure . When the heart is not able to pump efficiently, blood can back up into the blood vessels that take blood through the lungs. As the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid reduces normal oxygen movement through the lungs. These two factors combine to cause shortness of breath. Congestive heart failure that leads to pulmonary edema may be caused by: Heart attack, or any disease of the heart that weakens or stiffens the heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) Leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves) Sudden, severe high blood pressure (hypertension) Pulmonary edema may also be caused by: Certain medicines High altitude exposure Kidney failure Narrowed arteries that bring blood to the kidneys Lung damage caused by burns from poisonous gas inhalation or severe infection Major injury","Symptoms of pulmonary edema may include: Coughing up blood or bloody froth Difficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea) Feeling of ""air hunger"" or ""drowning"" (This feeling is called ""paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea"" if it causes you to wake up 1 to 2 hours after falling asleep and struggle to catch your breath.) Grunting, gurgling, or wheezing sounds with breathing Problems speaking in full sentences because of shortness of breath Other symptoms may include: Anxiety or restlessness Decrease in level of alertness Leg or abdominal swelling Pale skin Sweating (excessive)",,Lung congestion; Lung water; Pulmonary congestion; Heart failure - pulmonary edema
Pulmonary embolus,A pulmonary embolus is a blockage of an artery in the lungs. The most common cause of the blockage is a blood clot.,"A pulmonary embolus is most often caused by a blood clot that develops in a vein outside the lungs. The most common blood clot is one in a deep vein of the thigh or in the pelvis (hip area). This type of clot is called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) . The blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs where it lodges. Less common causes of a pulmonary embolus include air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or tumor cells. You are more likely to get a pulmonary embolus if you or your family has a history of blood clots or certain clotting disorders. A pulmonary embolus may occur: After childbirth During a hospital stay when you may be at bedrest or immobilized After severe injuries, burns, or fractures of the hips or thigh bone After surgery, most commonly bone, joint, or brain surgery During or after a long plane or car ride If you have cancer If you take birth control pills or estrogen therapy Long-term bed rest or staying in one position for a long time Disorders that may lead to blood clots include: Diseases of the immune system that make it harder for the blood to clot . Inherited disorders that make the blood more likely to clot. One such disorder is antithrombin III deficiency .","The main symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include chest pain that may be any of the following: Under the breastbone or on one side Sharp or stabbing Burning, aching, or a dull, heavy sensation Often gets worse with deep breathing You may bend over or hold your chest in response to the pain Other symptoms may include: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting Low oxygen level in blood (hypoxemia) Fast breathing or wheezing Fast heart rate Feeling anxious Leg pain, redness, or swelling Low blood pressure Sudden cough, possibly coughing up blood or bloody mucus Shortness of breath that starts suddenly during sleep or on exertion Low grade fever Bluish skin ( cyanosis ) -- less common",,Venous thromboembolism; Lung blood clot; Blood clot - lung; Embolus; Tumor embolus; Embolism - pulmonary; DVT - pulmonary embolism; Thrombosis - pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary thromboembolism; PE

Pulmonary hypertension,Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.,"The right side of the heart pumps blood into the pulmonary artery and then through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger and malfunction. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale . Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by: Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis Birth defects of the heart Blood clots in the lung ( pulmonary embolism ) Heart failure (of the left side of the heart) Heart valve disease HIV infection Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time ( chronic ) Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis or any other severe chronic lung condition Medicines (for example, certain diet medicines) Obstructive sleep apnea In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men. If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension.","Shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is often the first symptom. Fast heart rate ( palpitations ) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest. Other symptoms include: Ankle and leg swelling Bluish color of the lips or skin ( cyanosis ) Chest pain or pressure, most often in the front of the chest Dizziness or fainting spells Fatigue Increased abdominal size due to fluid buildup Weakness People with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go. They report good days and bad days.",,Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension; Familial primary pulmonary hypertension; Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension; Primary pulmonary hypertension; PPH; Secondary pulmonary hypertension; Cor pulmonale - pulmonary hypertension
Pulmonary nocardiosis,Pulmonary nocardiosis is an infection of the lung with Nocardia bacteria.,"Nocardia infection develops when you breathe in (inhale) the bacteria. The infection causes pneumonia -like symptoms. The infection can spread to any part of the body. People with a weak immune system are at a high risk for nocardia infection. This includes people who have: Been taking steroids or other medicines that weaken the immune system for a long time Cushing disease An organ transplant HIV/AIDS Lymphoma (a type of cancer ) Other people at risk include those with long-term (chronic) lung problems related to smoking, emphysema , or tuberculosis .","Pulmonary nocardiosis mainly affects the lungs. But, nocardiosis can also spread to other organs in the body. Common symptoms may include: ENTIRE BODY Fever (comes and goes) General ill feeling ( malaise ) Night sweats GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM Nausea Liver and spleen swelling ( hepatosplenomegaly ) Loss of appetite Unintentional weight loss Vomiting LUNGS AND AIRWAYS Breathing difficulty Chest pain not due to heart problems Coughing up blood or mucus Rapid breathing Shortness of breath MUSCLES AND JOINTS Joint pain NERVOUS SYSTEM Change in mental state Confusion Dizziness Headache Seizures Changes in vision SKIN Skin rashes or lumps Skin sores (abscesses) Swollen lymph nodes",,Nocardiosis - pulmonary; Mycetoma; Nocardia
Pulmonary tuberculosis,Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the lungs. It may spread to other organs.,"Pulmonary TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis) . TB is contagious. This means the bacteria may spread from an infected person to someone else. You can get TB by breathing in air droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person. The resulting lung infection is called primary TB. Most people recover from primary TB infection without further evidence of the disease. The infection may stay inactive (dormant) for years. In some people, it becomes active again (reactivates). Most people who develop symptoms of a TB infection first became infected in the past. In some cases, the disease becomes active within weeks after the primary infection. The following people are at higher risk of active TB or reactivation of TB: Older adults Infants People with weakened immune systems, for example due to HIV/AIDS , chemotherapy , diabetes, or medicines that weaken the immune system Your risk for catching TB increases if you: Are around people who have TB Live in crowded or unclean living conditions Have poor nutrition The following factors can increase the rate of TB infection in a population: Increase in HIV infections Increase in number of homeless people (poor environment and nutrition) Presence of drug-resistant strains of TB","The primary stage of TB does not cause symptoms. When symptoms of pulmonary TB occur, they can include: Breathing difficulty Chest pain Cough (usually with mucus) Coughing up blood Excessive sweating, particularly at night Fatigue Fever Weight loss Wheezing",,TB; Tuberculosis - pulmonary; Mycobacterium - pulmonary
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease,Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a very rare disease. It leads to high blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension).,"In most cases, the cause of PVOD is unknown. The high blood pressure occurs in the pulmonary arteries. These lung arteries are directly connected to the right side of the heart. The condition may be related to a viral infection. It may occur as a complication of certain diseases such as lupus , or bone marrow transplantation . The disorder is most common among children and young adults. As the disease gets worse, it causes: Narrowed pulmonary veins Pulmonary artery hypertension Congestion and swelling of the lungs Possible risk factors for PVOD include: Family history of the condition Smoking Exposure to substances like trichloroethylene or chemotherapy medicines Systemic sclerosis (autoimmune skin disorder)",Symptoms may include any of the following: Shortness of breath Dry cough Fatigue on exertion Fainting Coughing up blood Difficulty breathing while lying flat,,Pulmonary vaso-occlusive disease

Pulmonic valve stenosis,Pulmonic stenosis is a heart valve disorder that involves the pulmonary valve.,"Narrowing of the pulmonary valve is most often present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs as the baby develops in the womb before birth. The cause is unknown, but genes may play a role. Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called valvular pulmonic stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve. The defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe. Pulmonic stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families.","Many cases of pulmonic stenosis are mild and do not cause symptoms. The problem is most often found in infants when a heart murmur is heard during a routine heart exam. When the valve narrowing (stenosis) is moderate to severe, the symptoms include: Abdominal distention Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) in some people Poor appetite Chest pain Fainting Fatigue Poor weight gain or failure to thrive in infants with a severe blockage Shortness of breath Sudden death Symptoms may get worse with exercise or activity.",,Valvular pulmonary stenosis; Heart valve pulmonary stenosis; Pulmonary stenosis; Stenosis - pulmonary valve; Balloon valvuloplasty - pulmonary

Pupil – white,A white pupil is a condition that causes the pupil of the eye to look white instead of black.,"Causes of this condition may include: Coats disease - exudative retinopathy Coloboma Congenital cataract (may be hereditary or may result from other conditions, including congenital rubella , galactosemia , retrolental fibroplasia ) Persistent primary hyperplastic vitreous Retinoblastoma Toxocara canis (infection caused by a parasite) Uveitis",,"Most causes of white pupil will cause decreased vision. This may often occur before the pupil appears to be white. Detecting a white pupil is especially important in infants. Babies are unable to communicate to others that their vision is decreased. It is also harder to measure an infant's vision during an eye exam. If you see a white pupil, call your provider right away. Well-child exams routinely screen for a white pupil in children. A child who develops a white pupil or cloudy cornea needs immediate attention, preferably from an eye specialist. It is important to get diagnosed early if the problem is caused by retinoblastoma since this disease can be fatal.",Leukocoria
Purpura,"Purpura is purple-colored spots and patches that occur on the skin, and in mucus membranes, including the lining of the mouth.","Non-thrombocytopenic purpuras may be due to: Amyloidosis (disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs) Blood clotting disorders Congenital cytomegalovirus (condition in which an infant is infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus before birth) Congenital rubella syndrome Drugs that affect platelet function or clotting factors Fragile blood vessels seen in older people (senile purpura) Hemangioma (abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs) Inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura , which causes a raised type of purpura Pressure changes that occur during vaginal childbirth Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) Steroid use Certain infections Injury Thrombocytopenic purpura may be due to: Drugs that reduce the platelet count Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) -- a bleeding disorder Immune neonatal thrombocytopenia (can occur in infants whose mothers have ITP) Meningococcemia (bloodstream infection)",,,Blood spots; Skin hemorrhages

Pyloric stenosis in infants,Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the opening from the stomach into the small intestine. This is called the pylorus. This article describes the condition in infants.,"Normally, food passes easily from the stomach into the first part of the small intestine through a valve called the pylorus. With pyloric stenosis, the muscles of the pylorus are thickened. This prevents the stomach from emptying into the small intestine. The exact cause of the thickening is unknown. Genes may play a role, since children of parents who had pyloric stenosis are more likely to have this condition. Other risk factors include: Certain antibiotics Too much acid in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) Certain diseases a baby is born with, such as diabetes Pyloric stenosis occurs most often in infants younger than 6 months. It is more common in boys than in girls.","Vomiting is the first symptom in most children: Vomiting may occur after every feeding or only after some feedings. Vomiting usually starts around 3 weeks of age, but may start any time between 1 week and 5 months of age. Vomiting is forceful (projectile vomiting). The infant is hungry after vomiting and wants to feed again. Other symptoms appear several weeks after birth and may include: Abdominal pain Burping Constant hunger Dehydration (gets worse as vomiting gets worse) Failure to gain weight or weight loss Wave-like motion of the abdomen shortly after feeding and just before vomiting occurs",,Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis; Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis; Gastric outlet obstruction; Vomiting - pyloric stenosis

Pyruvate kinase deficiency,"Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited lack of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells (hemolytic anemia).","Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is passed down as an autosomal recessive trait. This means that a child must receive a non-working gene from each parent to develop the disorder. There are many different types of enzyme-related defects of the red blood cell that can cause hemolytic anemia. PKD is the second most common cause, after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. PKD is found in people of all ethnic backgrounds. But, certain populations, such as the Amish, are more likely to develop the condition.","Symptoms of PKD include: Low count of healthy red blood cells ( anemia ) Swelling of the spleen ( splenomegaly ) Yellow color of the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes ( jaundice ) Neurologic condition, called kernicterus , that affects the brain Fatigue, lethargy Pale skin ( pallor ) In infants, not gaining weight and growing as expected ( failure to thrive ) Gallstones, usually in the teens and older",,PK deficiency; PKD
Q fever,Q fever is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that are spread by domestic and wild animals and ticks.,"Q fever is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii , which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats.

Rabies,Rabies is a deadly viral infection that is mainly spread by infected animals.,"This infection is caused by the rabies virus. Rabies is spread by infected saliva that enters the body through a bite or broken skin. The virus travels from the wound to the brain, where it causes swelling or inflammation. This inflammation leads to symptoms of the disease. Most rabies deaths occur in children. In the past, human rabies cases in the United States usually resulted from a dog bite. Recently, more cases of human rabies have been linked to bats and raccoons. Dog bites are a common cause of rabies in developing countries, especially Asia and Africa. There have been no reports of rabies caused by dog bites in the United States for a number of years due to widespread animal vaccination. Other wild animals that can spread the rabies virus include: Foxes Skunks Bats Bats can spread rabies through minor or unrecognized bites or scratches. Bites can be so small you may not realize you have been bitten. If you find a bat in your home, you should contact your health care provider or health department, even if you don't feel or see a bite. They can advise you about whether you need treatment. In rare cases, rabies has been transmitted without an actual bite. This type of infection is believed to be caused by infected saliva or other infectious material that may come in contact with an existing scratch or wound, usually in bat caves.","The time between infection and when you get sick ranges from 10 days to 7 years. This time period is called the incubation period. The average incubation period is 3 to 12 weeks. Fear of water (hydrophobia) is the most common symptom.

Rash - child under 2 years,A rash is a change in the color or texture of the skin. A skin rash can be:,"Causes may include: Diaper rash (rash in the diaper area) is a skin irritation caused by long-term dampness and by urine and feces touching the skin. Yeast diaper rash is caused by a type of yeast called Candida, which also causes thrush in the mouth. The rash looks different from a regular diaper rash. It is very red, and there are usually small red bumps on the outer edges of the rash. This rash requires treatment with medicine. Heat rash, or prickly heat, is caused by the blockage of the pores that lead to the sweat glands. It is most common in very young children but can occur at any age. It is more common in hot and humid weather. The sweat is held within the skin and forms little red bumps or occasionally small blisters . Erythema toxicum can cause flat red splotches (usually with a white, pimple-like bump in the middle) that appear in up to one half of all babies. This rash rarely appears after 5 days of age, and most often disappears in 7 to 14 days. It is nothing to worry about. Baby acne is caused by exposure to the mother's hormones. Red bumps, sometimes with white dots in the center, may be seen on a newborn's face. Acne most often occurs between 2 and 4 weeks of age, but may appear up to 4 months after birth and can last for 12 to 18 months. Cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis) causes greasy, scaling, crusty patches on the scalp that appear in a baby's first 3 months. It most often goes away by itself, but some cases may require treatment with medicine. Eczema is a condition of the skin in which areas are dry, scaly, red (or darker than normal skin color), and itchy. When it goes on for a long time the areas become thickened. It is often associated with asthma and allergies, although it can often occur without either of these. Eczema often runs in families. Hives are red welts that often seem to move around on the body. For example, if you drew a circle to mark one of the welts, a few hours later that circle would not have a welt in it, but there may be welts on other parts of the body. They differ in size and shape. Hives may last for a few weeks. The cause is often uncertain.",,"DIAPER RASHES Keep the skin dry. Change wet diapers as quickly as possible. Allow the baby's skin to air dry as long as is practical. Launder cloth diapers in mild soap and rinse well. Avoid using plastic pants. Avoid irritating wipes (especially those containing alcohol) when cleaning the infant. Ointments or creams may help reduce friction and protect the baby's skin from irritation. Powders such as cornstarch or talc should be used cautiously, as they can be inhaled by the infant and may cause lung injury. If your baby has a yeast diaper rash , the health care provider will prescribe an antifungal cream to treat it. OTHER RASHES Heat rash or prickly heat is best treated by providing a cooler and less humid environment for the child. Powders are unlikely to help treat heat rash and should be stored out of reach of the infant to prevent accidental inhalation. Avoid ointments and creams because they tend to keep the skin warmer and block the pores. Erythema toxicum is normal in newborn babies and will go away on its own in a few days. You do not need to do anything for it. White or clear milia/miliaria will go away on their own. You do not need to do anything for it. For hives, talk with your provider to try to find the cause. Some causes require prescription medicines. Antihistamines may help stop the itching. BABY ACNE Normal washing is all that is necessary to treat baby acne most of the time. Use plain water or mild baby soap and only bathe your baby every 2 to 3 days. Avoid acne medicines used by adolescents and adults. CRADLE CAP For cradle cap, wash the hair or scalp with water or a mild baby shampoo. Use a brush to remove the flakes of dry skin. If this cannot be removed easily, apply an oil to the scalp to soften it. Cradle cap most often disappears by 18 months. If it does not disappear, it becomes infected, or if it is resistant to treatments, consult your provider. ECZEMA For skin problems caused by eczema , the keys to reducing rash are to reduce scratching and keep the skin moisturized. Keep the baby's fingernails short and consider putting soft gloves on the child at night to minimize scratching. Drying soaps and anything that has caused irritation in the past (including foods) should be avoided. Apply a moisturizing cream or ointment immediately after baths to avoid drying. Hot or long baths, or bubble baths, may be more drying and should be avoided. Loose, cotton clothing will help absorb perspiration. Consult a provider if these measures do not control the eczema. Your child may need prescription medicines for the eczema or if the skin begins to appear infected. While the majority of children with eczema will outgrow it, many will have sensitive skin as adults.",Baby rash; Miliaria; Prickly heat
Rashes,"Rashes involve changes in the color, feeling or texture of your skin.","A simple rash is called dermatitis, meaning inflammation of the skin. Contact dermatitis is caused by things your skin touches, such as: Chemicals in elastic, latex, and rubber products Cosmetics, soaps, and detergents Dyes and other chemicals in clothing Poison ivy, oak, or sumac Seborrheic dermatitis is a rash that appears in patches of redness and scaling around the eyebrows, eyelids, mouth, nose, trunk, and behind the ears. If it happens on your scalp, it is called dandruff in adults and cradle cap in infants. Age, stress, fatigue, weather extremes, oily skin, infrequent shampooing, and alcohol-based lotions aggravate this harmless but bothersome condition. Other common causes of a rash include: Eczema (atopic dermatitis) -- Tends to happen in people with allergies or asthma. The rash is generally red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis -- Tends to occur as red, scaly, patches over joints and along the scalp. It is sometimes itchy. Fingernails may also be affected. Impetigo -- Common in children, this infection is from bacteria that live in the top layers of the skin. It appears as red sores that turn into blisters, ooze, then form a honey colored crust over all or part of the rash. Shingles -- A painful blistered skin condition caused by the same virus as chickenpox. The virus can lie dormant in your body for many years and re-emerge as shingles. It usually affects only one side of the body. Childhood illnesses such as chickenpox , measles , roseola , rubella , hand-foot-mouth disease , fifth disease , and scarlet fever . Medicines and insect bites or stings . Many medical conditions can cause a rash as well. These include: Lupus erythematosus (an immune system disease) Rheumatoid arthritis , especially the juvenile type Kawasaki disease (inflammation of the blood vessels) Certain body-wide (systemic) viral, bacterial or fungal infections",,"Many simple rashes will improve with gentle skin care and by avoiding irritating substances. Follow these general guidelines: Avoid scrubbing your skin. Use gentle cleansers. Avoid applying cosmetic lotions or ointments directly on the rash. Use warm (not hot) water for cleaning. Pat dry, don't rub. Stop using any recently added cosmetics or lotions. Leave the affected area exposed to the air as much as possible. Try calamine medicated lotion for poison ivy, oak, or sumac, as well as for other types of contact dermatitis. Hydrocortisone cream (1%) is available without a prescription and may soothe many rashes. Stronger hydrocortisone or other steroid creams are available with a prescription. If you have eczema, apply moisturizers over your skin. Try oatmeal bath products, available at drugstores, to relieve symptoms of eczema or psoriasis.

Rat-bite fever,Rat-bite fever is a rare bacterial disease spread by the bite of an infected rodent.,"Rat-bite fever can be caused by either of two different bacteria, Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus. Both of these are found in the mouths of rodents. The disease is most often seen in: Asia Europe North America Most people get rat-bite fever through contact with urine or fluids from the mouth, eye, or nose of an infected animal. This most commonly occurs through a bite or scratch. Some cases may occur simply through contact with these fluids. A rat is usually the source of the infection. Other animals that may cause this infection include: Gerbils Squirrels Weasels","Symptoms depend on the bacteria that caused the infection. Symptoms due to Streptobacillus moniliformis may include: Chills Fever Joint pain, redness, or swelling Rash Symptoms due to Spirillum minus may include: Chills Fever Open sore at the site of the bite Rash with red or purple patches and bumps Swollen lymph nodes near the bite Symptoms from either organism usually resolve within 2 weeks.

Raynaud phenomenon,Raynaud phenomenon is a condition in which cold temperatures or strong emotions cause blood vessel spasms. This blocks blood flow to the affected regions and causes discoloration,"When Raynaud phenomenon is a primary condition, meaning it occurs by itself and not in association with other diseases, it is referred to as Raynaud disease. It most often begins in women younger than age 30. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is when the condition is linked to other conditions and can occur at any age. Common causes of secondary Raynaud phenomenon are: Diseases of the arteries (such as atherosclerosis and Buerger disease ) Drugs that cause narrowing of arteries (such as amphetamines, certain types of beta-blockers, some cancer drugs, certain drugs used for migraine headaches) Arthritis and autoimmune conditions (such as scleroderma , Sjögren syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) Certain blood disorders, such as cold agglutinin disease or cryoglobulinemia Repeated injury or usage such as from heavy use of hand tools or vibrating machines Smoking Frostbite Thoracic outlet syndrome","Exposure to the cold or strong emotions bring on the changes. First, the affected areas become white, and then turn blue. Fingers are most commonly involved, but toes, ears, lips or the nose can also change color as well. When blood flow returns, the area becomes red and then later returns to normal color. The attacks may last from minutes to hours. People with Raynaud disease have problems in the same fingers on both sides. Most people do not have much pain. The skin of the arms or legs may develop bluish blotches which goes away when the skin is warmed up. People with secondary Raynaud phenomenon are more likely to have pain or tingling in the fingers. Painful ulcers may form on the affected fingers if the attacks are severe.",,Raynaud disease; Primary Raynaud; Secondary Raynaud

Reactive arthritis,"Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that follows an infection. It may also cause inflammation of the eyes, skin and urinary and genital systems.","The exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown. However, it most often follows an infection, but the joint itself is not infected. Reactive arthritis most often occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 40, although it does sometimes affect women. It may follow an infection in the urethra after unprotected sex. The most common bacteria that cause such infections is called Chlamydia trachomatis. Reactive arthritis can also follow a gastrointestinal infection (such as food poisoning). In up to one half of people thought to have reactive arthritis, there may be no infection. It is possible that such cases are a form of spondyloarthritis . Certain genes may make you more likely to get this condition. The disorder is rare in young children, but it may occur in teenagers. Reactive arthritis may occur in children ages 6 to 14 after Clostridium difficile gastrointestinal infections.","Urinary symptoms will appear within days or weeks of an infection. These symptoms may include: Burning when urinating Fluid leaking from the urethra (discharge) Problems starting or continuing a urine stream Needing to urinate more often than normal A low fever along with eye discharge, burning, or redness ( conjunctivitis or ""pink eye"") can develop over the next several weeks. Infections in the intestine may cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. The diarrhea may be watery or bloody. Joint pain and stiffness also begin during this time period. The arthritis may be mild or severe. Arthritis symptoms may include: Heel pain or pain in the Achilles tendon Pain in the hip, knee, ankle, and low back Pain and swelling that affects one or more joints Symptoms may include skin sores on the palms and soles that look like psoriasis .

Red birthmarks,Red birthmarks are skin markings created by blood vessels close to the skin surface. They develop before or shortly after birth.,"There are two main categories of birthmarks: Red birthmarks are made up of blood vessels close to the skin surface. These are called vascular birthmarks. Pigmented birthmarks are areas in which the color of the birthmark is different from the color of the rest of the skin. Hemangiomas are a common type of vascular birthmark. Their cause is unknown. Their color is caused by the growth of blood vessels at the site. Different kinds of hemangiomas include: Strawberry hemangiomas (strawberry mark, nevus vascularis, capillary hemangioma, hemangioma simplex) may develop several weeks after birth. They may appear anywhere on the body, but are most often found on the neck and face. These areas consist of small blood vessels that are very close together. Cavernous hemangiomas (angioma cavernosum, cavernoma) are similar to strawberry hemangiomas, but they are deeper and may appear as a red-blue spongy area of tissue filled with blood. Salmon patches (stork bites) are very common. Up to half of all newborns have them. They are small, pink, flat spots made up of small blood vessels that can be seen through the skin. They are most common on the forehead, eyelids, upper lip, between the eyebrows, and on the back of the neck. Salmon patches may be more noticeable when an infant cries or during temperature changes. Port-wine stains are flat hemangiomas made of expanded tiny blood vessels (capillaries). Port-wine stains on the face may be associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. They are most often located on the face. Their size varies from very small to over half of the body's surface.",The main symptoms of birthmarks include: Marks on the skin that look like blood vessels Skin rash or lesion that is red,,Strawberry mark; Vascular skin changes; Angioma cavernosum; Capillary hemangioma; Hemangioma simplex
Reflux nephropathy,Reflux nephropathy is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged by the backward flow of urine into the kidney.,"Urine flows from each kidney through tubes called ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder is full, it squeezes and sends the urine out through the urethra. No urine should flow back into the ureter when the bladder is squeezing. Each ureter has a one-way valve where it enters the bladder that prevents urine from flowing back up the ureter. But in some people, urine flows back up to the kidney. This is called vesicoureteral reflux. Over time, the kidneys may be damaged or scarred by this reflux. This is called reflux nephropathy. Reflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well. Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy. Reflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including: Bladder outlet obstruction , such as an enlarged prostate in men Bladder stones Neurogenic bladder , which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions Reflux nephropathy can also occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter. Risk factors for reflux nephropathy include: Abnormalities of the urinary tract Personal or family history of vesicoureteral reflux Repeat urinary tract infections","Some people have no symptoms of reflux nephropathy. The problem may be found when kidney tests are done for other reasons. If symptoms do occur, they might be similar to those of: Chronic kidney failure Nephrotic syndrome Urinary tract infection",,Chronic atrophic pyelonephritis; Vesicoureteric reflux; Nephropathy - reflux; Ureteral reflux

Relapsing fever,Relapsing fever is a bacterial infection transmitted by a louse or tick. It is characterized by repeated episodes of fever.,"Relapsing fever is an infection caused by several species of bacteria in the borrelia family. There are two major forms of relapsing fever: Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is transmitted by the ornithodoros tick. It occurs in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia, and certain areas in the western United States and Canada. The bacteria species associated with TBRF are Borrelia duttonii , Borrelia hermsii , and Borrelia parkeri . Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted by body lice . It is most common in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. The bacteria species associated with LBRF is Borrelia recurrentis . Sudden fever occurs within 2 weeks of infection. In TBRF, multiple episodes of fever occur, and each may last up to 3 days. People may not have a fever for up to 2 weeks, and then it returns. In LBRF, the fever commonly lasts 3 to 6 days. It is often followed by a single, milder episode of fever. In both forms, the fever episode may end in ""crisis."" This consists of shaking chills, followed by intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure. This stage may result in death. In the United States, TBRF often occurs west of the Mississippi River, particularly in the mountains of the West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest. In the mountains of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, infections are usually caused by Borrelia hermsii and are often picked up in cabins in forests. The risk may now extend into the southeastern United States. LBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan. Famine, war, and the movement of refugee groups can result in clusters of LBRF epidemics.","Symptoms of relapsing fever include: Bleeding Coma Headache Joint aches, muscle aches Nausea and vomiting Sagging on one side of the face (facial droop) Stiff neck Sudden high fever, shaking chills, seizure Vomiting Weakness, unsteadiness while walking",,Tick-borne relapsing fever; Louse-borne relapsing fever

Renovascular hypertension,Renovascular hypertension is high blood pressure due to narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the kidneys. This condition is also called renal artery stenosis.,"Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys. The most common cause of renal artery stenosis is a blockage in the arteries. This problem most often occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries, causing a condition known as atherosclerosis. When the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low. As a result, they release hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water. This causes your blood pressure to rise. Risk factors for atherosclerosis: High blood pressure Smoking Diabetes High cholesterol Heavy alcohol use Cocaine use Increasing age Fibromuscular dysplasia is another cause of renal artery stenosis. It is typically seen in women under age 50. It tends to run in families. The condition is caused by abnormal growth of cells in the walls of the arteries leading to the kidneys. This also leads to narrowing or blockage of these arteries.","People with renovascular hypertension may have a history of very high blood pressure that is hard to bring down with medicines. Symptoms of renovascular hypertension include: High blood pressure at a young age High blood pressure that suddenly gets worse or is hard to control Kidneys that are not working well (this can start suddenly) Narrowing of other arteries in the body, such as to the legs, the brain, the eyes and elsewhere Sudden buildup of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs ( pulmonary edema ) If you have a dangerous form of high blood pressure called malignant hypertension, symptoms can include: Bad headache Nausea or vomiting Confusion Changes in vision Nosebleeds",,Renal hypertension; Hypertension - renovascular; Renal artery occlusion; Stenosis - renal artery; Renal artery stenosis; High blood pressure - renovascular

Respiratory acidosis,Respiratory acidosis is a condition that occurs when your lungs can’t remove all of the carbon dioxide produced by your body. This causes the blood and other body fluids to become too acidic.,"There are many causes of respiratory acidosis, including: Airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD Lung tissue diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis , which causes scarring and thickening of the lungs Diseases that can affect the chest, such as scoliosis Diseases that affect the nerves and muscles that signal the lungs to inflate or deflate Medicines that suppress breathing, including narcotics (opioids), and ""downers,"" such as benzodiazepines, often when combined with each other or alcohol Severe obesity, which restricts how much the lungs can expand Obstructive sleep apnea Chronic respiratory acidosis occurs over a long time. This leads to a stable situation, because the kidneys increase body chemicals, such as bicarbonate, that help restore the body's acid-base balance. Acute respiratory acidosis occurs when carbon dioxide builds up very quickly, before the kidneys can return the body to a state of balance. Some people with chronic respiratory acidosis get acute respiratory acidosis when a serious illness worsens their condition and disrupts their body's acid-base balance.",Symptoms may include: Confusion Anxiety Easy fatigue Lethargy Shortness of breath Sleepiness Tremors (shaking) Warm and flushed skin Sweating,,Ventilatory failure; Respiratory failure; Acidosis - respiratory

Most infants have had this infection by age 2. Outbreaks of RSV infections most often begin in the fall and run into the spring. The infection can occur in people of all ages. The virus spreads through tiny droplets that go into the air when a sick person blows their nose, coughs, or sneezes. You can catch RSV if: A person with RSV sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you. You touch, kiss, or shake hands with someone who is infected by the virus. You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob. RSV often spreads quickly in crowded households and day care centers. The virus can also live for many hours on hard surfaces such as countertops and doorknobs. It can live on soft surfaces such as tissues and hands for shorter amounts of time.","Symptoms appear in 4 to 6 days after infection with the virus. Symptoms can vary, depending on age.

It may occur more often in people with: Chronic kidney disease Diabetes Iron, magnesium, or folic acid deficiency Anemia (often due to iron deficiency) Parkinson disease Peripheral neuropathy Pregnancy Multiple sclerosis RLS may also occur in people who: Use certain medicines such as calcium channel blockers, lithium, or neuroleptics Are stopping sedative use Use caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine RLS occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults. Women are more likely to have RLS than men. RLS is commonly passed down in families. This may be a factor when symptoms start at a younger age.","RLS leads to unpleasant feelings in your lower legs. These feelings cause an unstoppable urge to move your legs. You may feel: Creeping and crawling Bubbling, pulling, or tugging Burning or searing Aching, throbbing, or pain Itching or gnawing Tingling, pins and needles in the feet These sensations: Are worse at night when you lie down to the point that it may interfere with sleep and keep you awake Sometimes occur during the day Start or get worse when you lie down or sit for long periods of time May last for 1 hour or longer Sometimes also occur in the upper legs, feet, or arms Are relieved when you move or stretch as long as you keep moving Symptoms can make it difficult to sit during air or car travel, or through classes or meetings. Stress or emotional upset can make symptoms worse. Most people with RLS have rhythmic leg movements when they sleep. This condition is called periodic limb movement disorder. All of these symptoms make it hard to sleep. Lack of sleep can lead to: Daytime sleepiness Anxiety or depression Confusion Difficulty thinking clearly",,Willis-Ekbom disease; Nocturnal myoclonus; RLS; Akathisia
Restrictive cardiomyopathy,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy refers to a set of changes in how the heart muscle functions. These changes cause the heart to fill poorly (more common) or squeeze poorly (less common). Sometimes, both problems are present.","In a case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is of normal size or slightly enlarged. Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole). Although the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. It also can occur after a heart transplant. Other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include: Cardiac amyloidosis Carcinoid heart disease Diseases of the heart lining (endocardium), such as endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler syndrome (rare) Iron overload (hemochromatosis) Sarcoidosis Scarring after radiation or chemotherapy Scleroderma Tumors of the heart","Symptoms of heart failure are most common. These symptoms often develop slowly over time. However, symptoms sometimes start very suddenly and are severe. Common symptoms are: Cough Breathing problems that occur at night, with activity or when lying flat Fatigue and inability to exercise Loss of appetite Swelling of the abdomen Swelling of the feet and ankles Uneven or rapid pulse Other symptoms may include: Chest pain Inability to concentrate Low urine output Need to urinate at night (in adults)",,Cardiomyopathy - restrictive; Infiltrative cardiomyopathy; Idiopathic myocardial fibrosis
Reticulocyte count,Reticulocytes are slightly immature red blood cells. A reticulocyte count is a blood test that measures the amount of these cells in the blood.,,,,Anemia - reticulocyte
Retina,The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball. Images that come through the eye's lens are focused on the retina. The retina then converts these images to electric signals and sends them along the optic nerve to the brain.,,,,
Retinal artery occlusion,Retinal artery occlusion is a blockage in one of the small arteries that carry blood to the retina. The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye that is able to sense light.,"Retinal arteries may become blocked when a blood clot or fat deposits get stuck in the arteries. These blockages are more likely if there is hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) in the eye. Clots may travel from other parts of the body and block an artery in the retina. The most common sources of clots are the heart and carotid artery in the neck. Most blockages occur in people with conditions such as: Carotid artery disease , in which the two large blood vessels in the neck become narrowed or blocked Diabetes Heart rhythm problem (mainly atrial fibrillation ) Heart valve problem High levels of fat in the blood (hyperlipidemia) High blood pressure Intravenous drug abuse Temporal arteritis (inflammation of arteries due to an immune response) If a branch of the retinal artery is blocked, part of the retina will not receive enough blood and oxygen. If this happens, you may lose part of your vision.","Sudden blurring or loss of vision may occur in: All of one eye (central retinal artery occlusion or CRAO) Part of one eye (branch retinal artery occlusion or BRAO) The retinal artery occlusion may last for only a few seconds or minutes, or it may be permanent. A blood clot in the eye may be a warning sign of clots elsewhere. A clot in the brain may cause a stroke.",,Central retinal artery occlusion; CRAO; Branch retinal artery occlusion; BRAO; Vision loss - retinal artery occlusion; Blurry vision - retinal artery occlusion
Retinal detachment,Retinal detachment is a separation of the light-sensitive membrane (retina) in the back of the eye from its supporting layers.,"The retina is the clear tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. Light rays that enter the eye are focused by the cornea and lens into images that are formed on the retina. The most common type of retinal detachment is often due to a tear or hole in the retina. This type of detachment is called a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Eye fluid may leak through this opening. This causes the retina to separate from the underlying tissues, much like a bubble under wallpaper. This is most often caused by a condition called posterior vitreous detachment. It can also be caused by trauma and severe nearsightedness. A family history of retinal detachment also increases your risk. Another type of retinal detachment is called tractional detachment. This type occurs in people who have uncontrolled diabetes, had retinal surgery before, or have long-term (chronic) inflammation. When the retina becomes detached, bleeding from nearby blood vessels can cloud the inside of the eye so that you may not see clearly or at all. Central vision becomes severely affected if the macula becomes detached. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.","Symptoms of detached retina can include: Bright flashes of light, especially in peripheral vision. Blurred vision . New floaters in the eye that appear suddenly. Shadowing or decreased peripheral vision that seems like a curtain or shade across your vision. There is usually no pain in or around the eye.",,Detached retina
Retinal detachment repair,Retinal detachment repair is eye surgery to place a retina back into its normal position. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. Detachment means that it has pulled away from the layers of tissue around it.,,,,Scleral buckling; Vitrectomy; Pneumatic retinopexy; Laser retinopexy; Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair
Retinal vein occlusion,Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.,"Retinal vein occlusion is most often caused by hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) and the formation of a blood clot. Blockage of smaller veins (branch veins or BRVO) in the retina often occurs in places where retinal arteries that have been thickened or hardened by atherosclerosis cross over and place pressure on a retinal vein. Risk factors for retinal vein occlusion include: Atherosclerosis Diabetes High blood pressure (hypertension) Other eye conditions, such as glaucoma , macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage The risk of these disorders increases with age, therefore retinal vein occlusion most often affects older people. Blockage of retinal veins may cause other eye problems, including: Glaucoma (high pressure in the eye), caused by new, abnormal blood vessels growing in the front part of the eye Macular edema, caused by the leakage of fluid in the retina",Symptoms include sudden blurring or vision loss in all or part of one eye.,,Central retinal vein occlusion; CRVO; Branch retinal vein occlusion; BRVO; Vision loss - retinal vein occlusion; Blurry vision - retinal vein occlusion
Retinitis pigmentosa,Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease in which there is damage to the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. This layer converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.,"Retinitis pigmentosa can run in families. The disorder can be caused by several genetic defects. The cells controlling night vision (rods) are most likely to be affected. However, in some cases, retinal cone cells are damaged the most. The main sign of the disease is the presence of dark deposits in the retina. The main risk factor is a family history of retinitis pigmentosa. It is a rare condition affecting about 1 in 4,000 people in the United States.","Symptoms often first appear in childhood. However, severe vision problems do not often develop before early adulthood. Decreased vision at night or in low light. Early signs may include having a harder time moving around in the dark. Loss of side (peripheral) vision, causing ""tunnel vision."" Loss of central vision (in advanced cases). This will affect the ability to read. Loss of color vision Sensitivity to bright light",,RP; Vision loss - RP; Night vision loss - RP; Rod Cone dystrophy; Peripheral vision loss - RP; Night blindness
Retinoblastoma,Retinoblastoma is a rare eye tumor that usually occurs in children. It is a malignant (cancerous) tumor of the part of the eye called the retina.,"Retinoblastoma is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls how cells divide. As a result, cells grow out of control and become cancerous. In about half the cases, this mutation develops in a child whose family has never had eye cancer. In other cases, the mutation occurs in several family members. If the mutation runs in the family, there is a 50% chance that an affected person's children will also have the mutation. These children will therefore have a high risk of developing retinoblastoma themselves. The cancer most often affects children younger than 7 years old. It is most commonly diagnosed in children 1 to 2 years old.","One or both eyes may be affected. The pupil of the eye may appear white or have white spots. A white glow in the eye is often seen in photographs taken with a flash. Instead of the typical ""red eye"" from the flash, the pupil may appear white or distorted. Other symptoms may include: Crossed eyes ( strabismus ) Double vision Eyes that do not align Eye pain and redness Poor vision Differing iris colors in each eye If the cancer has spread, bone pain and other symptoms may occur.",,Tumor - retina; Cancer - retina; Eye cancer - retinoblastoma
Retinopathy of prematurity,Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal blood vessel development in the retina of the eye in infants that are born too early (premature).,"The blood vessels of the retina (in the back of the eye) begin to develop about 3 months into pregnancy. In most cases, they are fully developed at the time of normal birth. The eyes may not develop properly if a baby is born very early. The vessels may stop growing or grow abnormally from the retina into the back of the eye. Because the vessels are fragile, they can leak and cause bleeding in the eye. Scar tissue may develop and pull the retina loose from the inner surface of the eye (retinal detachment). In severe cases, this can result in vision loss. In the past, the use of too much oxygen in treating premature babies caused vessels to grow abnormally. Better methods are now available for monitoring oxygen. As a result, the problem has become less common, especially in developed countries. However, there is still uncertainty about the right level of oxygen for premature babies at different ages. Researchers are studying other factors besides oxygen which appear to influence the risk of ROP. Today, the risk of developing ROP depends on the degree of prematurity. Smaller babies with more medical problems are at higher risk. Almost all babies who are born before 30 weeks or weigh less than 3 pounds (1500 grams or 1.5 kilograms) at birth are screened for the condition. Some high-risk babies who weigh 3 to 4.5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) or who are born after 30 weeks should also be screened. In addition to prematurity, other risk factors may include: Brief stop in breathing (apnea) Heart disease High carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the blood Infection Low blood acidity (pH) Low blood oxygen Respiratory distress Slow heart rate (bradycardia) Transfusions The rate of ROP in most premature infants has gone down greatly in developed countries over the past few decades due to better care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, more babies born very early are now able to survive, and these very premature infants are at the highest risk for ROP.","The blood vessel changes cannot be seen with the naked eye. An eye exam by an ophthalmologist is needed to reveal such problems. There are five stages of ROP: Stage I: There is mildly abnormal blood vessel growth. Stage II: Blood vessel growth is moderately abnormal. Stage III: Blood vessel growth is severely abnormal. Stage IV: Blood vessel growth is severely abnormal and there is a partially detached retina. Stage V: There is a total retinal detachment. An infant with ROP may also be classified as having ""plus disease"" if the abnormal blood vessels match pictures used to diagnose the condition. Symptoms of severe ROP include: Abnormal eye movements Crossed eyes Severe nearsightedness White-looking pupils (leukocoria)",,Retrolental fibroplasia; ROP
Retrograde cystography,Retrograde cystography is a detailed x-ray of the bladder. Contrast dye is placed into the bladder through the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.,,,,Cystography - retrograde; Cystogram
Retrograde ejaculation,"Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen goes backward into the bladder. Normally, it moves forward and out of the penis through the urethra during ejaculation.","Retrograde ejaculation is uncommon. It most often occurs when the opening of the bladder (bladder neck) does not close. This causes semen to go backward into the bladder rather than forward out of the penis. Retrograde ejaculation may be caused by: Diabetes Some medicines, including drugs used to treat high blood pressure and some mood-altering drugs Medicines or surgery to treat prostate or urethra problems",Symptoms include: Cloudy urine after orgasm Little or no semen is released during ejaculation,,Ejaculation retrograde; Dry climax
Retroperitoneal fibrosis,Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare disorder that blocks the tubes (ureters) that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.,Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurs when extra fibrous tissue forms in the area behind the stomach and intestines. The tissue forms a mass (or masses) or tough fibrotic tissue. It can block the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder. The cause of this problem is mostly unknown. It is most common in people aged 40 to 60. Men are twice as likely to develop the condition as women.,"Early symptoms: Dull pain in the abdomen or flank that increases with time Pain and change of color in the legs (due to decreased blood flow) Swelling of one leg Later symptoms: Decreased urine output No urine output (anuria) Nausea, vomiting, changes in mental status caused by kidney failure and build-up of toxic chemicals in the blood Severe abdominal pain with blood in the stool (due to death of intestinal tissue)",,Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis; Ormond's disease
Retroperitoneal inflammation,"Retroperitoneal inflammation causes swelling that occurs in the retroperitoneal space. Over time, it can lead to a mass behind the abdomen and its contents called retroperitoneal fibrosis.","Retroperitoneal inflammation and fibrosis is a rare condition. There is no clear cause in about 70% of cases. It most likely develops due to inflammation of the abdominal aortic artery. Conditions that can rarely lead to this include: Abdominal radiation therapy for cancer Cancer -- bladder, breast, colon, lymphoma, prostate, sarcoma Carcinoid tumor Crohn disease Infections -- tuberculosis, histoplasmosis Certain medicines, such as methysergide, ergotamine, pergolide, methyldopa, etanercept and infliximab Surgery of structures in the retroperitoneum",Symptoms include: Abdominal pain Anorexia Flank pain Low back pain Malaise,,Retroperitonitis
Retropharyngeal abscess,Retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the tissues in the back of the throat. It can be a life-threatening medical condition.,"Retropharyngeal abscess most often affects children under age 5, but it can occur at any age. Infected material (pus) builds up in the space around the tissues at the back of the throat. This can occur during or very soon after a throat infection.",Symptoms include: Breathing difficulty Difficulty swallowing Drooling High fever High-pitched sound when inhaling ( stridor ) Muscles between the ribs pull in when breathing ( intercostal retractions ) Severe throat pain Difficulty turning the head,,

Retroversion of the uterus,"Retroversion of the uterus occurs when a woman's uterus (womb) tilts backward rather than forward. It is commonly called a ""tipped uterus.""",Retroversion of the uterus is common. Approximately 1 in 5 women has this condition. The condition may also occur due to weakening of the pelvic ligaments at the time of menopause . Scar tissue or adhesions in the pelvis can also hold the uterus in a retroverted position. Scarring may come from: Endometriosis Infection in the uterus or fallopian tubes Pelvic surgery,"Retroversion of the uterus almost never causes any symptoms. Rarely, it may cause pain or discomfort.",,Uterus retroversion; Malposition of the uterus; Tipped uterus; Tilted uterus
Rett syndrome,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a disorder of the nervous system. This condition leads to developmental problems in children. It mostly affects language skills and hand use.,"RTT occurs almost always in girls. It may be diagnosed as autism or cerebral palsy. Most RTT cases are due to a problem in the gene called MECP2. This gene is on the X chromosome. Females have 2 X chromosomes. Even when one chromosome has this defect, the other X chromosome is normal enough for the child to survive. Males born with this defective gene do not have a second X chromosome to make up for the problem. Therefore, the defect usually results in miscarriage , stillbirth , or very early death.","An infant with RTT usually has normal development for the first 6 to 18 months. Symptoms range from mild to severe. Symptoms may include: Breathing problems, which may get worse with stress. Breathing is usually normal during sleep and abnormal while awake. Change in development. Excessive saliva and drooling. Floppy arms and legs, which is frequently the first sign. Intellectual disabilities and learning difficulties. Scoliosis . Shaky, unsteady, stiff gait or toe walking. Seizures . Slowing head growth beginning at 5 to 6 months of age. Loss of normal sleep patterns. Loss of purposeful hand movements: For example, the grasp used to pick up small objects is replaced by repetitive hand motions like hand wringing or constant placement of hands in mouth. Loss of social engagement. Ongoing, severe constipation and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD ). Poor circulation that can lead to cold and bluish arms and legs. Severe language development problems. NOTE: Problems with breathing patterns may be the most upsetting and difficult symptom for parents to watch. Why they happen and what to do about them is not well understood. Most experts recommend that parents remain calm through an episode of irregular breathing like breath holding. It may help to remind yourself that normal breathing always returns and that your child will become used to the abnormal breathing pattern.",,RTT; Scoliosis - Rett syndrome; Intellectual disability - Rett syndrome

Reye syndrome,Reye syndrome is characterized by sudden (acute) brain damage and liver function problems. This condition does not have a known cause.,There is no known cause of Reye syndrome. It is most often seen in children ages 4 to 12. Most cases that occur with chickenpox are in children ages 5 to 9. Cases that occur with the flu are most often in children ages 10 to 14.,"Children with Reye syndrome get sick very suddenly. The syndrome often begins with vomiting. It may last for many hours. The vomiting is quickly followed by irritable and aggressive behavior. As the condition gets worse, the child may be unable to stay awake and alert. Other symptoms of Reye syndrome: Confusion Lethargy Loss of consciousness or coma Mental changes Nausea and vomiting Seizures Unusual placement of arms and legs ( decerebrate posture ). The arms are extended straight and turned toward the body, the legs are held straight, and the toes are pointed downward Other symptoms that can occur with this disorder include: Double vision Hearing loss Muscle function loss or paralysis of the arms or legs Speech difficulties Weakness in the arms or legs",,Reye's syndrome

Rh incompatibility,Rh incompatibility is a condition that develops when a pregnant woman has Rh-negative blood and the baby in her womb has Rh-positive blood.,"During pregnancy, red blood cells from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's blood through the placenta. If the mother is Rh-negative, her immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as if they were a foreign substance. The mother's body makes antibodies against the fetal blood cells. These antibodies may cross back through the placenta into the developing baby. They destroy the baby's circulating red blood cells. When red blood cells are broken down, they make bilirubin . This causes an infant to become yellow (jaundiced). The level of bilirubin in the infant's blood may range from mild to dangerously high. Firstborn infants are often not affected unless the mother had past miscarriages or abortions. This would sensitize her immune system. This is because it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies. All children she has later who are also Rh-positive may be affected. Rh incompatibility develops only when the mother is Rh-negative and the infant is Rh-positive. This problem has become less common in places that provide good prenatal care. This is because special immune globulins called RhoGAM are routinely used.","Rh incompatibility can cause symptoms ranging from very mild to deadly. In its mildest form, Rh incompatibility causes the destruction of red blood cells. There are no other effects. After birth, the infant may have: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and lethargy",,Rh-induced hemolytic disease of the newborn; Erythroblastosis fetalis
Rhabdomyolysis,Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood. These substances are harmful to the kidney and often cause kidney damage.,"When muscle is damaged, a protein called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells. Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle. Problems that may lead to this disease include: Trauma or crush injuries Use of drugs or medicines such as cocaine , amphetamines, statins, heroin , or PCP Genetic muscle diseases Extremes of body temperature Ischemia or death of muscle tissue Low phosphate levels Seizures or muscle tremors Severe exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenics Lengthy surgical procedures Severe dehydration","Symptoms may include: Dark, red, or cola-colored urine Decreased urine output General weakness Muscle stiffness or aching ( myalgia ) Muscle tenderness Weakness of the affected muscles Other symptoms that may occur with this disease: Fatigue Joint pain Seizures Weight gain (unintentional)",,
Rhabdomyosarcoma,Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancerous (malignant) tumor of the muscles that are attached to the bones. This cancer mostly affects children.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma can occur in many places in the body. The most common sites are the head or neck, the urinary or reproductive system, and the arms or legs. The cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is unknown. It is a rare tumor with only several hundred new cases per year in the United States. Some children with certain birth defects are at an increased risk. Some families have a gene mutation that increases this risk. Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma do not have any known risk factors.","The most common symptom is a mass that may or may not be painful. Other symptoms vary depending on location of the tumor. Tumors in the nose or throat may cause bleeding, congestion, swallowing problems, or nervous system problems if they extend into the brain. Tumors around the eyes may cause bulging of the eye, problems with vision, swelling around the eye, or pain. Tumors in the ears, may cause pain, hearing loss, or swelling. Bladder and vaginal tumors may cause trouble starting to urinate or having a bowel movement, or poor control of urine.

Rheumatic fever,"Rheumatic fever is a disease that may develop after an infection with group A streptococcus bacteria (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It can cause severe illness in the heart, joints, skin, and brain.","Rheumatic fever is still common in countries that have a lot of poverty and poor health systems. It does not often occur in the United States and other developed countries. When rheumatic fever does occur in the United States, it is most often in small outbreaks. The latest outbreak in the United States was in the 1980s. Rheumatic fever occurs after infections with a germ or bacteria called Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus. This germ appears to trick the immune system into attacking healthy tissues in the body. These tissues become swollen or inflamed. This abnormal reaction seems to almost always occur with strep throat or scarlet fever. Strep infections that involve other parts of the body do not seem to trigger rheumatic fever.","Rheumatic fever mainly affects children ages 5 to 15 who have had strep throat or scarlet fever. If it occurs, it develops about 14 to 28 days after these illnesses. Symptoms can affect many systems in the body. General symptoms may include: Fever Nosebleeds Pain in the abdomen Heart problems, which may have no symptoms, or may lead to shortness of breath and chest pain Symptoms in the joints can: Cause pain, swelling, redness, and warmth Mainly occur in the knees, elbows, ankles, and wrists Change or move from one joint to another Skin changes may also occur, such as: Ring-shaped or snake-like skin rash on the trunk and upper part of the arms or legs Skin lumps or nodules A condition that affects the brain and nervous system, called Sydenham chorea , can also occur.

Rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that leads to inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues. It is a long-term disease. It can also affect other organs.,"The cause of RA is not known. It is an autoimmune disease. This means the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. RA can occur at any age, but is more common in middle age. Women get RA more often than men. Infection, genes, and hormone changes may be linked to the disease. Smoking may also be linked to RA. It is less common than osteoarthritis (OA) which is a joint condition that occurs in many people due to wear and tear on the joints as they age.","Most of the time, RA affects joints on both sides of the body equally. Fingers, wrists, knees, feet, elbows, ankles, hips and shoulders are the most commonly affected. The lower spine is usually not affected by RA. The disease often begins slowly. Early symptoms may include: Minor joint pain Stiffness Fatigue Joint symptoms may include: Morning stiffness, which lasts more than 1 hour, is common. Joints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for an hour. Joint pain is often felt in the same joint on both sides of the body. Joints are often swollen. Over time, joints may lose their range of motion and may become deformed. Other symptoms include: Chest pain when taking a breath ( pleurisy ) Dry eyes and mouth ( Sjögren syndrome ) Eye burning, itching, and discharge Nodules under the skin (most often a sign of more severe disease) Numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and feet Sleep difficulties The diagnosis of RA is made when: You have pain and swelling in 3 or more joints. Arthritis has been present for longer than 6 weeks. You have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. You have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Other types of arthritis have been ruled out.

Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis,"Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (RP, also known as Caplan syndrome) is swelling (inflammation) and scarring of the lungs. It occurs in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have breathed in dust, such as from coal (coal worker's pneumoconiosis) or silica.","RP is caused by breathing in inorganic dust. This is dust that comes from grinding metals, minerals, or rock. After the dust enters the lungs, it causes inflammation. This can lead to the formation of many small lumps in the lungs and an airway disease similar to mild asthma. It is not clear how RP develops. There are two theories: When people breathe in inorganic dust, it affects their immune system and leads to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake. When people who already have RA or are at high risk for it are exposed to mineral dust, they develop RP.",Symptoms of RP are: Cough Joint swelling and pain Lumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules) Shortness of breath Wheezing,,RP; Caplan syndrome; Pneumoconiosis - rheumatoid; Silicosis - rheumatoid pneumoconiosis; Coal worker's pneumoconiosis - rheumatoid pneumoconiosis

Riboflavin,"Riboflavin is a type of B vitamin. It is water soluble, which means it is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.",,,,Vitamin B2
Rickets,"Rickets is a disorder caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It leads to softening and weakening of the bones.","Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones. Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who: Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight Must stay indoors Work indoors during the daylight hours You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you: Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products) DO NOT drink milk products Follow a vegetarian diet Infants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months. This is because there are lower levels of sunlight during these months. Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in the diet is rare in developed countries. Calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables. Your genes may increase your risk for rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis . Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body. Sometimes, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver. These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form. Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth. This is the age when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may also be seen in children ages 6 to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns.","Symptoms of rickets include: Bone pain or tenderness in the arms, legs, pelvis, and spine Decreased muscle tone (loss of muscle strength) and weakness that gets worse Dental deformities, including delayed tooth formation, defects in the tooth structure, holes in the enamel, and increased cavities ( dental caries ) Impaired growth Increased bone fractures Muscle cramps Short stature (adults less than 5 feet or 1.52 meters tall) Skeletal deformities such as an odd-shaped skull, bowlegs , bumps in the ribcage (rachitic rosary), breastbone that is pushed forward (pigeon chest), pelvic deformities, and spine deformities (spine that curves abnormally, including scoliosis or kyphosis )",,Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets

Rocky Mountain spotted fever,Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a disease caused by a type of bacteria carried by ticks.,"RMSF is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii (R Rickettsii) , which is carried by ticks. The bacteria is spread to humans through a tick bite. In the western United States, the bacteria are carried by the wood tick. In the eastern US, they are carried by the dog tick. Other ticks spread the infection in the southern US and in Central and South America. Contrary to the name ""Rocky Mountain,"" most recent cases have been reported in the eastern US. States include North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Most cases occur in the spring and summer and are found in children. Risk factors include recent hiking or exposure to ticks in an area where the disease is known to occur. The bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted to a person by a tick that has been attached for less than 20 hours. Only about 1 in 1,000 ticks carry the bacteria. Bacteria can also infect people who crush ticks they have removed from pets with their bare fingers. Not all people will remember getting a tick bite.","Symptoms usually develop about 2 to 14 days after the tick bite. They may include: Chills and fever Confusion Headache Muscle pain Rash -- usually starts a few days after the fever; first appears on wrists and ankles as spots that are 1 to 5 mm in diameter, then spreads to most of the body. Some infected people don't get a rash.

It usually does not itch.",,Exanthem subitum; Sixth disease
Rotator cuff problems,"The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that attach to the bones of the shoulder joint, allowing the shoulder to move and keep it stable.","The shoulder joint is a ball and socket type joint. The top part of the arm bone (humerus) forms a joint with the shoulder blade (scapula). The rotator cuff holds the head of the humerus into the scapula. It also controls movement of the shoulder joint. TENDINITIS The tendons of the rotator cuff pass underneath a bony area on their way to attaching the top part of the arm bone. When these tendons become inflamed, they can become more inflamed over this area during shoulder movements. Sometimes, a bone spur narrows the space even more. Rotator cuff tendinitis is also called impingement syndrome. Causes of this condition include: Keeping the arm in the same position for long periods, such as doing computer work or hairstyling Sleeping on the same arm each night Playing sports requiring the arm to be moved overhead repeatedly such as in tennis, baseball (particularly pitching), swimming, and lifting weights overhead Working with the arm overhead for many hours or days, such as in painting and carpentry Poor posture over many years Aging Rotator cuff tears TEARS Rotator cuff tears may occur in two ways: A sudden acute tear may happen when you fall on your arm while it is stretched out. Or, it can occur after a sudden, jerking motion when you try to lift something heavy. A chronic tear of the rotator cuff tendon occurs slowly over time. It is more likely when you have chronic tendinitis or impingement syndrome. At some point, the tendon wears down and tears. There are two types of rotator cuff tears: A partial tear occurs when a tear does not completely sever the attachments to the bone. A complete, full thickness tear means that the tear goes all the way through the tendon. It may be as small as a pinpoint, or the tear may involve the entire tendon. With complete tears, the tendon has come off (detached) from where it was attached to the bone. It can also be retracted and be pulled away from the bone. This kind of tear does not heal on its own.","TENDINITIS Early on, pain is mild and occurs with overhead activities and lifting your arm to the side. Activities include brushing your hair, reaching for objects on shelves, or playing an overhead sport. Pain is more likely in the front of the shoulder and may travel to the side of the arm. The pain always stops before the elbow. If the pain goes down the arm to the elbow and hand, this may indicate a pinched nerve in the neck. There may also be pain when you lower the shoulder from a raised position. Over time, there may be pain at rest or at night, such as when lying on the affected shoulder. You may have weakness and loss of motion when raising the arm above your head. Your shoulder can feel stiff with lifting or movement. It may become more difficult to place the arm behind your back. ROTATOR CUFF TEARS The pain with a sudden tear after a fall or injury is usually intense. Right after the injury, you will likely have weakness of the shoulder and arm. It may be hard to move your shoulder or raise your arm above the shoulder. You may also feel snapping when trying to move the arm. With a chronic tear, you often do not notice when it began. This is because symptoms of pain, weakness, and stiffness or loss of motion worsen slowly over time. Rotator cuff tendon tears often cause pain at night. The pain may even wake you. During the day, the pain is more tolerable, and usually only hurts with certain movements, such as overhead or reaching toward the back. Over time, the symptoms become much worse and are not relieved by medicines, rest, or exercise.",,Swimmer's shoulder; Pitcher's shoulder; Shoulder impingement syndrome; Tennis shoulder; Tendinitis - rotator cuff; Rotator cuff tendinitis; Shoulder overuse syndrome

A person with rubella may spread the disease to others from 1 week before the rash begins, until 1 to 2 weeks after the rash disappears. Because the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given to most children, rubella is much less common now. Almost everyone who receives the vaccine has immunity to rubella. Immunity means that your body has built a defense to the rubella virus. In some adults, the vaccine may wear off. This means they are not fully protected. Women who may become pregnant and other adults may receive a booster shot. Children and adults who were never vaccinated against rubella may also get this infection.","Children generally have few symptoms.

Salivary duct stones,Salivary duct stones are deposits of minerals in the ducts that drain the salivary glands. Salivary duct stones are a type of salivary gland disorder.,"Spit (saliva) is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. The chemicals in saliva can form a hard crystal that can block the salivary ducts. When saliva cannot exit a blocked duct, it backs up into the gland. This may cause pain, swelling, or an infection of the gland. There are three pairs of major salivary glands: Parotid glands -- These are the two largest glands. One is located in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Inflammation of one or more of these glands is called parotitis, or parotiditis. Submandibular glands -- These two glands are located just under both sides of the jaw and carry saliva up to the floor of mouth under the tongue. Sublingual glands -- These two glands are located just under the front area of the floor of the mouth. Salivary stones most often affect the submandibular glands.

Salivary gland tumors,Salivary gland tumors are abnormal cells growing in the gland or in the tubes (ducts) that drain the salivary glands.,"The salivary glands are located around the mouth. They produce saliva, which moistens food to help with chewing and swallowing. Saliva also helps to protect teeth from decay. There are 3 main pairs of salivary glands. The parotid glands are the largest. They are located in each cheek in front of the ears. Two submandibular glands are under the floor of the mouth on both sides of the back of the jaw. Two sublingual glands are under the floor of the mouth next to the jaw on each side. There are also hundreds of small salivary glands lining the rest of the mouth. These are called the minor salivary glands. Salivary glands empty saliva into the mouth through ducts that open at various places in the mouth. Salivary gland tumors are rare. Swelling of the salivary glands is mostly due to: Cirrhosis of the liver Other cancers Salivary duct stones Salivary gland infections Dehydration Sarcoidosis Sjögren syndrome The most common type of salivary gland tumor is a slow-growing noncancerous (benign) tumor of the parotid gland.

Scabies,Scabies is an easily-spread skin disease caused by a very small mite.,"Scabies is found among people of all groups and ages around the world. Scabies spread by skin-to-skin contact with another person who has scabies. Scabies is easily spread among people who are in close contact. Whole families are often affected. Outbreaks of scabies are more common in nursing homes, nursing facilities, college dorms, and child care centers. The mites that cause scabies burrow into the skin and lay their eggs. This forms a burrow that looks like a pencil mark. Eggs hatch in 21 days. The itchy rash is an allergic response to the mite. Pets and animals usually do not spread human scabies. It is also very unlikely for scabies to be spread through swimming pools. It is difficult to spread scabies through clothing or bed linen. A type of scabies called crusted (Norwegian) scabies is a severe infestation with very large numbers of mites.

Causes of seizures can include: Abnormal levels of sodium or glucose in the blood Brain infection, including meningitis and encephalitis Brain injury that occurs to a baby during labor or childbirth Brain problems that occur before birth (congenital brain defects) Brain tumor (a rare cause) Electric shock Epilepsy Fever (particularly in young children ) Head injury Heart disease Heat illness ( heat intolerance ) High fever Phenylketonuria ( PKU ), which can cause seizures in infants Poisoning Street drugs, such as angel dust (PCP), cocaine, and amphetamines Stroke Toxemia of pregnancy Toxin buildup in the body due to liver or kidney failure Very high blood pressure ( malignant hypertension ) Venomous bites and stings (such as a snake bite ) Withdrawal from alcohol or certain medicines after using it for a long time Sometimes, no cause can be found. This is called idiopathic seizures. They are usually seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. There may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures. If seizures continue repeatedly after any underlying problem is treated, the condition is called epilepsy.",,"Most seizures stop by themselves. But during a seizure, the person can be hurt. When a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the person from injury: Try to prevent a fall. Lay the person on the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. Cushion the person's head. Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck. Turn the person on their side. If vomiting occurs, this helps make sure that the vomit is not inhaled into the lungs. Look for a medical ID bracelet with seizure instructions. Stay with the person until they recover or until professional medical help arrives. Things friends and family members should NOT do: DO NOT restrain (try to hold down) the person. DO NOT place anything between the person's teeth during a seizure (including your fingers). DO NOT attempt to hold the person's tongue. DO NOT move the person unless they are in danger or near something hazardous. DO NOT try to make the person stop convulsing. They have no control over the seizure and are not aware of what is happening at the time. DO NOT give the person anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and the person is fully awake and alert. DO NOT start CPR unless the seizure has clearly stopped and the person is not breathing or has no pulse. If a baby or child has a seizure during a high fever, cool the child slowly with lukewarm water. DO NOT place the child in a cold bath. Call your child's health care provider and ask what you should do next. Also, ask if it is OK to give the child acetaminophen (Tylenol) once they are awake.",Secondary seizures; Seizure - secondary; Convulsions; Epileptic seizure
Selective deficiency of IgA,Selective deficiency of IgA is the most common immune deficiency disorder. People with this disorder have a low or absent level of a blood protein called immunoglobulin A.,"Selective IgA deficiency is usually inherited, which means it is passed down through families. However, there are also cases of drug-induced selective IgA deficiency. It may be inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait. It is usually found in people of European origin. It is less common in people of other ethnicities.","Many people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. If a person does have symptoms, they may include frequent episodes of: Bronchitis (airway infection) Chronic diarrhea Conjunctivitis (eye infection) Gastrointestinal inflammation, including ulcerative colitis , Crohn disease , and a sprue-like illness Mouth infection Otitis media (middle ear infection) Pneumonia (lung infection) Sinusitis (sinus infection) Skin infections Upper respiratory tract infections Other symptoms include: Bronchiectasis (a disease in which the bronchial tubes in the lungs become damaged and enlarged) Asthma without a known cause",,IgA deficiency; Immunodepressed - IgA deficiency; Immunosuppressed - IgA deficiency; Hypogammaglobulinemia - IgA deficiency; Agammaglobulinemia - IgA deficiency
Selective mutism,"Selective mutism is a condition in which a child can speak, but then suddenly stops speaking. It most often takes place in school or social settings.","Selective mutism is most common in children under age 5. The cause, or causes, are unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with selective mutism have some form of extreme social fear ( phobia ). Parents often think that the child is choosing not to speak. However in most cases, the child is truly unable to speak in certain settings. Some affected children have a family history of selective mutism, extreme shyness, or anxiety disorders, which may increase their risk for similar problems. This syndrome is not the same as mutism. In selective mutism, the child can understand and speak, but is unable to speak in certain settings or environments. Children with mutism never speak.","Symptoms include: Ability to speak at home with family Fear or anxiety around people they do not know well Inability to speak in certain social situations Shyness This pattern must be seen for at least 1 month to be called selective mutism. (The first month of school does not count, because shyness is common during this period.)",,

Sensorimotor polyneuropathy,Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a condition that causes a decreased ability to move and feel (sensation) because of nerve damage.,"Neuropathy means a disease of, or damage to nerves. When it occurs outside of the central nervous system (CNS), that is, the brain and spinal cord, it is called a peripheral neuropathy . Mononeuropathy means one nerve is involved. Polyneuropathy means that many nerves in different parts of the body are involved. Neuropathy can affect nerves that provide feeling (sensory neuropathy) or cause movement (motor neuropathy). It can also affect both, in which case it is called a sensorimotor neuropathy. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is a bodywide (systemic) process that damages nerve cells, nerve fibers ( axons ), and nerve coverings ( myelin sheath). Damage to the covering of the nerve cell causes nerve signals to slow or stop. Damage to the nerve fiber or entire nerve cell can make the nerve stop working. Some neuropathies develop over years, while others can start and get severe within hours to days. Nerve damage can be caused by: Autoimmune (when the body attacks itself) disorders Conditions that put pressure on nerves Decreased blood flow to the nerve Diseases that destroy the glue (connective tissue) that holds cells and tissues together Swelling (inflammation) of the nerves Medical conditions including metabolic disorders Toxins Some diseases lead to polyneuropathy that is mainly sensory or mainly motor. Possible causes of sensorimotor polyneuropathy include: Alcoholic neuropathy Amyloid polyneuropathy Autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndrome Cancer (called a paraneoplastic neuropathy) Long-term (chronic) inflammatory neuropathy Diabetic neuropathy Chronic kidney disease Drug-related neuropathy , including chemotherapy Guillain-Barré syndrome Hereditary neuropathy HIV/AIDS Low thyroid Parkinson disease Vitamin deficiency ( vitamins B12 , B1 , and E) Various infections","Symptoms may include any of the following: Decreased feeling in any area of the body Difficulty swallowing or breathing Difficulty using the arms or hands Difficulty using the legs or feet Difficulty walking Pain, burning, tingling, or abnormal feeling in any area of the body (called neuralgia ) Weakness of the face, arms, or legs, or any area of the body Falls due to lack of balance and not feeling the ground under your feet Symptoms may develop quickly (as in Guillain-Barré syndrome) or slowly over weeks to years. Symptoms usually occur on both sides of the body. Most often, they start at the ends of the toes first.",,Polyneuropathy - sensorimotor
Sensorineural deafness,"Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the place of origin of the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or damage to the brain itself.","The inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings), that change sounds into electric signals. The nerves then carry these signals to the brain. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to these special cells, or to the nerve fibers in the inner ear. Sometimes, the hearing loss is caused by damage to the nerve that carries the signals to the brain. Sensorineural deafness that is present at birth (congenital) is most often due to: Genetic syndromes Infections that the mother passes to her baby in the womb ( toxoplasmosis , rubella , herpes ) SNHL may develop in children or adults later in life (acquired) as a result of: Age-related hearing loss Disease of the blood vessels Immune disease Infections, such as meningitis , mumps , scarlet fever , and measles Injury of the ear or head Loud noises or sounds, or loud sounds that last for a long time Meniere disease Tumor, such as acoustic neuroma Use of certain medicines Working around loud noises every day In some cases, the cause is unknown.",,,Nerve deafness; Hearing loss - sensorineural; Acquired hearing loss; SNHL; Noise-induced hearing loss; NIHL; Presbycusis
Separation anxiety in children,Separation anxiety in children is a developmental stage in which the child is anxious when separated from their primary caregiver (usually the mother).,"As infants grow, their emotions and reactions to the world around them seem to occur in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they lack a sense of what is normal and safe and what may be dangerous. As a result, new settings or people seem to not frighten them. From 8 to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, they feel threatened and unsafe. Separation anxiety is a normal stage as a child grows and develops. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master the world around them. It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. It's also normal for them to test their independence. To get over separation anxiety, children need to: Feel safe in their home. Trust people other than their parents. Trust that their parents will return. Even after children have mastered this stage, separation anxiety may return in times of stress. Most children will feel some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, most often when separated from their parents. When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are under stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. Since anxiety can worsen pain, staying with a child as much as possible can reduce the pain.","A child with severe separation anxiety may have any of the following: Excessive distress when separated from their primary caregiver Nightmares Reluctance to go to school or other places because of fear of separation Reluctance to go to sleep without their primary caregiver nearby Repeated physical complaints Worry about losing, or harm coming to their primary caregiver",,
Sepsis,"Sepsis is an illness in which the body has a severe, inflammatory response to bacteria or other germs.","The symptoms of sepsis are not caused by the germs themselves. Instead, chemicals the body releases cause the response. A bacterial infection anywhere in the body may set off the response that leads to sepsis. Common places where an infection might start include the: Bloodstream Bones (common in children) Bowel (usually seen with peritonitis ) Kidneys (upper urinary tract infection , pyelonephritis or urosepsis) Lining of the brain ( meningitis ) Liver or gallbladder Lungs ( bacterial pneumonia ) Skin ( cellulitis ) For people in or recently discharged from the hospital, common sites of infection include intravenous lines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and sites of skin breakdown, known as bedsores or pressure ulcers . Sepsis commonly affects infants or older adults.","In sepsis, blood pressure drops, resulting in shock . Major organs and body systems, including the kidneys, liver, lungs, and central nervous system may stop working properly because of poor blood flow. A change in mental status and very fast breathing may be the earliest signs of sepsis. In general, symptoms of sepsis can include: Chills Confusion or delirium Fever or low body temperature ( hypothermia ) Lightheadedness due to low blood pressure Rapid heartbeat Skin rash or mottled skin Warm skin",,Septicemia; Sepsis syndrome; Systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SIRS; Septic shock
Septic arthritis,"Septic arthritis is inflammation of a joint due to a bacterial or fungal infection. Septic arthritis that is due to the bacteria that cause gonorrhea, has different symptoms and is called gonococcal arthritis.","Septic arthritis develops when bacteria or other tiny disease-causing organisms (microorganisms) spread through the blood to a joint. It may also occur when the joint is directly infected with a microorganism from an injury or during surgery. Joints that are commonly affected are the knee and hip. Most cases of acute septic arthritis are caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria. Chronic septic arthritis (which is less common) is caused by organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans . The following conditions increase your risk for septic arthritis: Artificial joint implants Bacterial infection somewhere else in your body Presence of bacteria in your blood Chronic illness or disease (such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis , and sickle cell disease ) Intravenous (IV) or injection drug use Medicines that suppress your immune system Recent joint injury Recent joint arthroscopy or other joint surgery Septic arthritis may be seen at any age. In children, it occurs most often in those younger than 3 years. The hip is often the site of infection in infants. Most cases are caused by the bacteria group B streptococcus. Another common cause is Haemophilus influenza , especially if the child has not been vaccinated for this bacterium.","Symptoms usually come on quickly. There is a fever and joint swelling that is usually in just one joint. There is also intense joint pain, which gets worse with movement. Symptoms in newborns or infants: Crying when infected joint is moved (for example, during diaper changes) Fever Not able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis) Fussiness Symptoms in children and adults: Not able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis) Severe joint pain Joint swelling Joint redness Fever Chills may occur, but are uncommon.",,Bacterial arthritis; Non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis
Septic shock,Septic shock is a serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.,"Septic shock occurs most often in the very old and the very young. It may also occur in people with weakened immune systems. Any type of bacteria can cause septic shock. Fungi and (rarely) viruses may also cause the condition. Toxins released by the bacteria or fungi may cause tissue damage. This may lead to low blood pressure and poor organ function. Some researchers think that blood clots in small arteries cause the lack of blood flow and poor organ function. The body may respond to the toxins with a strong inflammatory response that may contribute to organ damage. Risk factors for septic shock include: Diabetes Diseases of the genitourinary system, biliary system , or intestinal system Diseases that weaken the immune system, such as AIDS Indwelling catheters (those that remain in place for extended periods, especially intravenous lines and urinary catheters, and plastic and metal stents used for drainage) Leukemia Long-term use of antibiotics Lymphoma Recent infection Recent surgery or medical procedure Recent or current use of steroid medicines Recent chemotherapy for any type of cancer Solid organ or bone marrow transplantation","Septic shock can affect any part of the body, including the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and intestines. Symptoms may include: Cool, pale arms and legs High or very low temperature, chills Lightheadedness Little or no urine Low blood pressure, especially when standing Palpitations Rapid heart rate Restlessness, agitation , lethargy, or confusion Shortness of breath Skin rash or discoloration Decreased mental status and confusion",,Bacteremic shock; Endotoxic shock; Septicemic shock; Warm shock

Serotonin syndrome,"Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction. It causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by some nerve cells.","SS most often occurs when two or more medicines or drugs that affect the body's level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The medicines cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area. For example, you can develop this syndrome if you take migraine medicines called triptans together with antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs). Common SSRIs include: Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Fluoxetine (Prozac) Paroxetine (Paxil) Sertraline (Zoloft) SSNRIs include: Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) Duloxetine (Cymbalta) Levomilnacipran (Fetzima) Milnacipran (Savella) Venlafaxine (Effexor) Common triptans include: Almotriptan (Axert) Eletriptan (Relpax) Frovatriptan (Frova) Naratriptan (Amerge) Rizatriptan (Maxalt) Sumatriptan (Imitrex) Zolmitriptan (Zomig) If you take these medicines, be sure to read the warning on the packaging. It tells you about the potential risk of SS. However, do not stop taking your medicine. Talk to your health care provider about your concerns first. SS is more likely to occur when you first start taking or increase the dose of the medicine.. Older antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also cause SS when combined with the medicines described above, as well as meperidine (Demerol, a painkiller), fentanyl, dextromethorphan (cough medicine), and others. Street drugs, such as methamphetamine or other amphetamines , cocaine , opiates, ecstasy, LSD , and others have also been associated with SS.","Symptoms occur within minutes to hours of taking medicines that can cause SS, and may include: Agitation or restlessness Abnormal eye movements Diarrhea Fast heartbeat and high blood pressure Hallucinations Increased body temperature Loss of coordination Nausea and vomiting Overactive reflexes Rapid changes in blood pressure",,Hyperserotonemia; Serotonergic syndrome; Serotonin toxicity; SSRI - serotonin syndrome; MAO - serotonin syndrome
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor,Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) is a rare cancer of the ovaries. The cancer cells produce and release a male sex hormone called testosterone.,The exact cause of this tumor is not known. Changes (alterations) in genes may play a role. SLCT occur most often in young women 20 to 30 years old. But the tumor can occur at any age.,"The Sertoli cells are normally located in the male reproductive glands (the testes). They feed sperm cells. The Leydig cells, also located in the testes, release a male sex hormone. These cells are also found in a woman's ovaries, and in very rare cases lead to cancer. SLCT starts in the female ovaries, mostly in one ovary. The cancer cells release a male sex hormone. As a result, the woman may develop symptoms such as: A deep voice Enlarged clitoris Facial hair Loss in breast size Stopping of menstrual periods Pain in the lower belly (pelvic area) is another symptom.

Serum sickness,"Serum sickness is a reaction that is similar to an allergy. The immune system reacts to medicines that contain proteins used to treat immune conditions. It can also react to antiserum, the liquid part of blood that contains antibodies given to a person to help protect them against germs or poisonous substances.","Plasma is the clear fluid portion of blood. It does not contain blood cells. But it does contain many proteins, including antibodies, which are formed as part of the immune response to protect against infection. Antiserum is produced from the plasma of a person or animal that has immunity against an infection or poisonous substance. Antiserum may be used to protect a person who has been exposed to a germ or toxin. For example, you may receive a certain type of antiserum injection: If you have been exposed to tetanus or rabies and have never been vaccinated against these germs. This is called passive immunization. If you have been bitten by a snake that produces a dangerous toxin. During serum sickness, the immune system falsely identifies a protein in antiserum as a harmful substance ( antigen ). The result is an immune system response that attacks the antiserum. Immune system elements and the antiserum combine to form immune complexes, which cause the symptoms of serum sickness. Certain medicines (such as penicillin, cefaclor, and sulfa) can cause a similar reaction. Injected proteins such as antithymocyte globulin (used to treat organ transplant rejection) and rituximab (used to treat immune disorders and cancers) can cause serum sickness reactions. Blood products may also cause serum sickness.","Unlike other medicine allergies , which occur very soon after receiving the medicine, serum sickness develops 7 to 21 days after the first exposure to a medicine. Some people develop symptoms in 1 to 3 days if they have already been exposed to the medicine. Symptoms of serum sickness can include: Fever General ill feeling Hives Itching Joint pain and swelling Rash Swollen lymph nodes",,Drug allergy - serum sickness; Allergic reaction - serum sickness; Allergy - serum sickness
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious form of pneumonia. Infection with the SARS virus causes acute respiratory distress (severe breathing difficulty), and sometimes death.","SARS is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is one of the coronavirus family of viruses (the same family that can cause the common cold ). An epidemic of SARS started in 2003 when the virus spread from small mammals to people in China. This outbreak quickly reached global proportions, but was contained in 2003. No new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004. When someone with SARS coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray into the air. You can catch the SARS virus if you breathe in or touch these particles. The SARS virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to several hours in these droplets. The virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing. While the spread of droplets through close contact caused most of the early SARS cases, SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets has touched. Airborne transmission is a real possibility in some cases. Live virus has also been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to 4 days. With other coronaviruses, becoming infected and then getting sick again (reinfection) is common. This may also be the case with SARS. Symptoms usually occur 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus. People with active symptoms of illness are contagious. But it is not known for how long a person may be contagious after symptoms appear.","Most people who get SARS will have symptoms. The main symptoms are: Cough Difficulty breathing Fever of 100.4°F (38.0°C) or higher Other breathing symptoms The most common symptoms are: Chills and shaking Cough, usually starts 2 to 7 days after other symptoms Headache Muscle aches Tiredness Less common symptoms include: Cough that produces phlegm (sputum) Diarrhea Dizziness Nausea and vomiting In some people, the lung symptoms get worse during the second week of illness, even after the fever has stopped.",,SARS; Respiratory failure - SARS; SARS coronavirus; SARS-CoV

Shaken baby syndrome,Shaken baby syndrome is a severe form of child abuse caused by violently shaking an infant or child.,"Most cases are due to an angry parent or caregiver shaking the baby to punish or quiet it. Such shaking most often takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control. Many times the caregiver did not intend to harm the baby. Still, it is a form of child abuse . Injuries are most likely to happen when the baby is shaken and then the baby's head hits something. Even hitting a soft object, such as a mattress or pillow, may be enough to injure newborns and small infants. Children's brains are softer, their neck muscles and ligaments are weak, and their heads are large and heavy in proportion to their bodies. The result is a type of whiplash , similar to what occurs in some auto accidents. Shaken baby syndrome does not result from gentle bouncing, playful swinging or tossing the child in the air, or jogging with the child. It also is very unlikely to occur from accidents such as falling off chairs or down stairs, or accidentally being dropped from a caregiver's arms. Short falls may cause other types of head injuries, although these are often minor.","The symptoms can vary, ranging from mild to severe. They may include: Convulsions ( seizures ) Decreased alertness Extreme irritability or other changes in behavior Lethargy , sleepiness , not smiling Loss of consciousness Loss of vision No breathing Pale or bluish skin Poor feeding, lack of appetite Vomiting There may not be any physical signs of injury, such as bruising, bleeding, or swelling. In some cases, the condition can be difficult to diagnose and may not be found during an office visit. However, rib fractures are common and can be seen on x-rays.

Sheehan syndrome,Sheehan syndrome is a condition that can occur in a woman who bleeds severely during childbirth. Sheehan syndrome is a type of hypopituitarism.,"Severe bleeding during childbirth can cause tissue in the pituitary gland to die. This gland does not work properly as a result. The pituitary gland is at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that stimulate growth, production of breast milk, reproductive functions, the thyroid, and the adrenal glands. A lack of these hormones can lead to a variety of symptoms. Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan syndrome include multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus. The condition is rare today due to advances in obstetric care.","Symptoms of Sheehan syndrome may include: Inability to breastfeed (breast milk never ""comes in"") Fatigue Lack of menstrual bleeding Loss of pubic and armpit (axillary) hair Low blood pressure Note: Other than not being able to breastfeed, symptoms may not develop for several years after the delivery.",,Postpartum hypopituitarism; Postpartum pituitary insufficiency; Hypopituitarism syndrome; Sheehan's syndrome

Shigellosis,Shigellosis is a bacterial infection of the lining of the intestines. It is caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella.,"There are several types of Shigella bacteria, including: Shigella sonnei , also called ""group D"" Shigella, is responsible for most cases of shigellosis in the United States. Shigella flexneri , or ""group B"" Shigella, causes almost all other cases. Shigella dysenteriae, or ""group A"" Shigella is rare in the United States. However, it can lead to deadly outbreaks in developing countries. People infected with the bacteria release it into their stool. They can spread the bacteria to water or food, or directly to another person. Getting just a little bit of the Shigella bacteria into your mouth is enough to cause infection. Outbreaks of shigellosis are linked to poor sanitation, contaminated food and water, and crowded living conditions. Shigellosis is common among travelers in developing countries and workers or residents in refugee camps. In the United States, the condition is most commonly seen in daycare centers and places where groups of people live, such as nursing homes.","Symptoms often develop about 1 to 7 days (average 3 days) after coming into contact with the bacteria.

Shingles,"Shingles is a painful, blistering skin rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes family of viruses. This is the virus that also causes chickenpox.","After you get chickenpox, your body does not get rid of the virus. Instead, the virus remains in the body but is inactive (becomes dormant) in certain nerves in the body. Shingles occurs after the virus becomes active again in these nerves after many years. Many people had such a mild case of chickenpox that they do not realize they have had the infection. The reason the virus suddenly becomes active again is not clear. Often only one attack occurs. Shingles can develop in any age group. You are more likely to develop the condition if: You are older than age 60 You had chickenpox before age 1 Your immune system is weakened by medicines or disease If an adult or child has direct contact with the shingles rash and did not have chickenpox as a child or get the chickenpox vaccine , they can develop chickenpox, not shingles.","The first symptom is usually pain, tingling, or burning that occurs on one side of the body. The pain and burning may be severe and are usually present before any rash appears. Red patches on the skin, followed by small blisters, form in most people: The blisters break, forming small sores that begin to dry and form crusts. The crusts fall off in 2 to 3 weeks. Scarring is rare. The rash usually involves a narrow area from the spine around to the front of the abdomen or chest. The rash may instead involve the face, eyes, mouth, and ears. Other symptoms may include: Fever and chills General ill feeling Headache Joint pain Swollen glands (lymph nodes) You may also have pain, muscle weakness, and a rash involving different parts of your face if shingles affects a nerve in your face. The symptoms may include: Difficulty moving some of the muscles in the face Drooping eyelid (ptosis) Hearing loss Loss of eye motion Taste problems Vision problems",,Herpes zoster - shingles
Shock,Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body is not getting enough blood flow. Lack of blood flow means the cells and organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Many organs can be damaged as a result. Shock requires immediate treatment and can get worse very rapidly. As many as 1 in 5 people in shock will die from it.,"Shock can be caused by any condition that reduces blood flow, including: Heart problems (such as heart attack or heart failure ) Low blood volume (as with heavy bleeding or dehydration ) Changes in blood vessels (as with infection or severe allergic reactions ) Certain medicines that significantly reduce heart function or blood pressure Slow heart rates and changes in blood vessel tone from spinal injuries A collapsed lung (pneumothorax) Shock is often associated with heavy external or internal bleeding from a serious injury. Toxic shock syndrome is an example of shock that is caused by an infection.","A person in shock has extremely low blood pressure. Depending on the specific cause and type of shock, symptoms will include one or more of the following: Anxiety or agitation/restlessness Bluish lips and fingernails Chest pain Confusion Dizziness , lightheadedness, or faintness Pale, cool, clammy skin Low or no urine output Profuse sweating , moist skin Rapid but weak pulse Shallow breathing Being unconscious (unresponsive)",,

Short bowel syndrome,Short bowel syndrome is a problem that occurs when part of the small intestine is missing or has been removed during surgery. Nutrients are not properly absorbed into the body as a result.,"The small intestine absorbs much of the nutrients found in foods we eat. When two-thirds or more of the small intestine is missing, the body may not absorb enough food to stay healthy and maintain your weight. Some infants are born missing part or much of their small intestine. More often, short bowel syndrome occurs because much of the small intestine is removed during surgery. This type of surgery may be needed: After gunshots or other trauma damaged the intestines For someone with severe Crohn disease For infants, often born too early, when part of their intestines dies When blood flow to the small intestine is reduced due to blood clots or narrowed arteries","Symptoms may include: Diarrhea Fatigue Pale, greasy stools Swelling ( edema ), especially of the legs Very foul-smelling stools Weight loss Dehydration",,Small intestine insufficiency; Short gut syndrome; Necrotizing enterocolitis - short bowel
Short philtrum,A short philtrum is a shorter than normal distance between the upper lip and the nose.,This condition can be caused by: Chromosome 18q deletion syndrome Cohen syndrome DiGeorge syndrome Oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFD),,"No home care is needed for a short philtrum, in most cases. However, if this is only one symptom of another disorder, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to care for the condition.",
Short stature,A child who has short stature is much shorter than children who are the same age and sex.,"There are many reasons why your child could have short stature. Most of the time, there is no medical cause for short stature. Your child may be small for their age, but is growing OK. They will probably start puberty later than their friends. Your child will most likely keep growing after most of their peers have stopped growing, and will probably be as tall as their parents. Providers call this ""constitutional growth delay."" If one or both parents are short, your child will most likely also be short. Your child should get as tall as one of their parents. Sometimes, short stature may be a symptom of a medical condition. Bone or skeletal disorders, such as: Rickets Achondroplasia Long-term (chronic) diseases, such as: Asthma Celiac disease Congenital heart disease Cushing disease Diabetes Hypothyroidism Inflammatory bowel disease Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Kidney disease Sickle cell anemia Thalassemia Genetic conditions, such as: Down syndrome Noonan syndrome Russell-Silver syndrome Turner syndrome Williams syndrome Other reasons include: Growth hormone deficiency Infections of the developing baby before birth Malnutrition Poor growth of a baby while in the womb ( intrauterine growth restriction ) or small for gestational age This list does not include every possible cause of short stature.",,,Idiopathic short stature; Non-growth hormone deficient short stature

Shoulder pain,Shoulder pain is any pain in or around the shoulder joint.,"The most common cause of shoulder pain occurs when rotator cuff tendons become trapped under the bony area in the shoulder. The tendons become inflamed or damaged. This condition is called rotator cuff tendinitis or bursitis. Shoulder pain may also be caused by: Arthritis in the shoulder joint Bone spurs in the shoulder area Bursitis , which is inflammation of a fluid-filled sac (bursa) that normally protects the joint and helps it move smoothly Broken shoulder bone Dislocation of the shoulder Shoulder separation Frozen shoulder , which occurs when the muscles, tendons, and ligaments inside the shoulder become stiff, making movement difficult and painful Overuse or injury of nearby tendons, such as the bicep muscles of the arms Nerve injury that leads to abnormal shoulder movement Tears of the rotator cuff tendons Poor shoulder posture and mechanics Sometimes, shoulder pain may be due to a problem in another area of the body, such as the neck or lungs. This is called referred pain. There is usually pain at rest and no worsening of pain when moving the shoulder.",,"Here are some tips for helping shoulder pain get better: Put ice on the shoulder area for 15 minutes, then leave it off for 15 minutes. Do this 3 to 4 times a day for 2 to 3 days. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not put ice directly on the skin because this can result in frostbite. Rest your shoulder for the next few days. Slowly return to your regular activities. A physical therapist can help you do this safely. Taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) may help reduce inflammation and pain. Rotator cuff problems can be treated at home also. If you have had shoulder pain before, use ice and ibuprofen after exercising. Learn exercises to stretch and strengthen your rotator cuff tendons and shoulder muscles. A health care provider or physical therapist can recommend such exercises. If you are recovering from tendinitis, continue to do range-of-motion exercises to avoid frozen shoulder. Practice good posture to keep your shoulder muscles and tendons in their right positions.",Pain - shoulder

Sick sinus syndrome,"Normally, the heartbeat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. It is called the sinoatrial node, sinus node or SA node. Its role is to keep the heart beat steady and regular.","Sick sinus syndrome most often occurs in people older than age 50. It is often due to scar-like damage to electrical pathways in the heart muscle tissue. In children, heart surgery on the upper chambers is a common cause of sick sinus syndrome. Coronary heart disease , high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valve diseases may occur with sick sinus syndrome. However, these diseases may have nothing to do with the syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome is uncommon, but not rare. It is the most common reason people need to have an artificial pacemaker implanted. Sinus bradycardia occurs more often than the other types of the condition. Tachycardias (rapid heart rhythms) that start in the upper chambers of the heart may be part of the syndrome. These include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia. A period of fast heart rates is often followed by very slow heart rates. When there are periods of both slow and fast heart rates (rhythms) the condition often will be called tachy-brady syndrome. Some medicines can make abnormal heart rhythms worse, especially when doses are high. These include digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and antiarrhythmics.","Most of the time, there are no symptoms. Symptoms that do occur may mimic those of other disorders. Symptoms may include: Chest pain or angina Confusion or other changes in mental status Fainting or near-fainting Fatigue Dizziness or lightheadedness Sensation of feeling the heart beat ( palpitations ) Shortness of breath , possibly only with physical activity like walking",,Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome; Sinus node dysfunction; Slow heart rate - sick sinus; Tachy-brady syndrome; Sinus pause - sick sinus; Sinus arrest - sick sinus
Sickle cell anemia - resources,The following organizations are good resources for information on sickle cell anemia:,,,,
Sickle cell disease,Sickle cell disease is a disorder passed down through families. The red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shape. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.,"Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin S changes the red blood cells. The red blood cells become fragile and shaped like crescents or sickles. The abnormal cells deliver less oxygen to the body's tissues. They can also easily get stuck in small blood vessels and break into pieces. This can interrupt healthy blood flow and cut down even more on the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues. Sickle cell disease is inherited from both parents. If you get the sickle cell gene from only one parent, you will have sickle cell trait . People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is much more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. It is also seen in people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.","Symptoms usually do not occur until after the age of 4 months. Almost all people with sickle cell disease have painful episodes called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the lower back, leg, joints, and chest. Some people have one episode every few years. Others have many episodes each year. The crises can be severe enough to require a hospital stay. When sickle cell disease becomes more severe, symptoms may include: Fatigue Paleness Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Yellowing of the eyes and skin ( jaundice ) Younger children with sickle cell disease have attacks of abdominal pain . The following symptoms may occur because small blood vessels become blocked by the abnormal cells: Painful and prolonged erection ( priapism ) Poor eyesight or blindness Problems with thinking or confusion caused by small strokes Ulcers on the lower legs (in adolescents and adults) Over time, the spleen stops working. As a result, people with sickle cell disease may have symptoms of infections such as: Bone infection ( osteomyelitis ) Gallbladder infection ( cholecystitis ) Lung infection ( pneumonia ) Urinary tract infection Other signs and symptoms include: Delayed growth and puberty Painful joints caused by arthritis Heart or liver failure due to too much iron (from blood transfusions)",,Anemia - sickle cell; Hemoglobin SS disease (Hb SS); Sickle cell anemia

Silent thyroiditis,"Silent thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland. The disorder can cause hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism.","The cause of the disease is unknown. But it is related to an attack against the thyroid by the immune system . The disease affects women more often than men. The disease can occur in women who have just had a baby. It can also be caused by medicines such as interferon and amiodarone, and some types of chemotherapy, which affect the immune system.","The earliest symptoms result from an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). These symptoms may last for up to 3 months. Symptoms are often mild, and may include: Fatigue , feeling weak Frequent bowel movements Heat intolerance Increased appetite Increased sweating Irregular menstrual periods Mood changes, such as irritability Muscle cramps Nervousness, restlessness Palpitations Weight loss Later symptoms may be of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), including: Fatigue Constipation Dry skin Irregular (or heavy) menstrual periods in women Mood changes Weight gain Cold intolerance These symptoms can persist until the thyroid recovers normal function.

Silicosis,Silicosis is a lung disease caused by breathing in (inhaling) silica dust.,"Silica is a common, naturally-occurring crystal. It is found in most rock beds. Silica dust forms during mining, quarrying, tunneling, and working with certain metal ores. Silica is a main part of sand, so glass workers and sand-blasters are also exposed to silica. Three types of silicosis occur: Chronic silicosis results from long-term exposure (more than 20 years) to low amounts of silica dust. The silica dust causes swelling in the lungs and chest lymph nodes. This disease may cause people to have trouble breathing. This is the most common form of silicosis. Accelerated silicosis occurs after exposure to larger amounts of silica over a shorter period of time (3 to 10 years). Swelling in the lungs and symptoms occur faster than in simple silicosis. Acute silicosis results from short-term exposure to very large amounts of silica. The lungs become very inflamed and can fill with fluid, causing severe shortness of breath and a low blood oxygen level. People who work in jobs where they are exposed to silica dust are at risk. These jobs include: Abrasives manufacturing Glass manufacturing Mining Quarrying Road and building construction Sand blasting Stone cutting Intense exposure to silica can cause disease within a year. But it usually takes at least 10 years of exposure before symptoms occur. Silicosis has become less common since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) created regulations requiring the use of protective equipment, which limits the amount of silica dust workers inhale.",Symptoms include: Cough Shortness of breath Weight loss,,Acute silicosis; Chronic silicosis; Accelerated silicosis; Progressive massive fibrosis; Conglomerate silicosis; Silicoproteinosis
Simple goiter,A simple goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is usually not a tumor or cancer.,"The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system . It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism . Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter. The body needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. If you do not have enough iodine in your diet, the thyroid gets larger to try and capture all the iodine it can, so it can make the right amount of thyroid hormone. So, a goiter can be a sign the thyroid is not able to make enough thyroid hormone. The use of iodized salt in the United States prevents a lack of iodine in the diet for people who use it. Other causes of goiter include: The body's immune system attacking the thyroid gland ( autoimmune problem ) Certain medicines (lithium, amiodarone) Infections (rare) Cigarette smoking Eating very large amounts of certain foods (soy, peanuts, or vegetables in the broccoli and cabbage family) Toxic nodular goiter , an enlarged thyroid gland that has a small growth or many growths called nodules, which produce too much thyroid hormone Simple goiters are more common in: People over age 40 People with a family history of goiter People who are born and raised in areas with iodine deficiency Women","The main symptom is an enlarged thyroid gland. The size may range from a single small nodule to a large mass at the front of the neck. Some people with a simple goiter may have symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland. In rare cases, an enlarged thyroid can put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and food tube (esophagus). This can lead to: Breathing difficulties (with very large goiters), especially when lying flat on the back or when reaching up with your arms Cough Hoarseness Swallowing difficulties, especially with solid food Pain in the area of the thyroid",,Goiter - simple; Endemic goiter; Colloidal goiter; Nontoxic goiter

Sinusitis,"Sinusitis is present when the tissue lining the sinuses become swollen or inflamed. It occurs as the result of an inflammatory reaction or an infection from a virus, bacteria, or fungus.","The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull. They are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. Most of the time, mucus is able to drain out and air is able to flow through the sinuses. When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow more easily. Sinusitis can occur from one of these conditions: Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses fail to properly move mucus out. This may be due to some medical conditions. Colds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or the associated inflammation may block the opening of the sinuses. A deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or nasal polyps may block the opening of the sinuses. Chronic infection can cause mucosal swelling and inflammation. There are three types of sinusitis: Acute sinusitis is when symptoms are present for 4 weeks or less. It is caused by viruses or bacteria growing in the sinuses. Chronic sinusitis is when the symptoms and swelling of the sinuses is present for longer than 3 months. It may be caused by bacteria or a fungus. Subacute sinusitis is when the symptoms and swelling is present from 1 to 3 months. The following may increase the risk that an adult or child will develop sinusitis: Allergic rhinitis or hay fever Cystic fibrosis Going to day care Diseases that prevent the cilia from working properly Changes in altitude (flying or scuba diving) Large adenoids Smoking Weakened immune system from HIV or chemotherapy Abnormal sinus structures","The symptoms of acute sinusitis in adults very often follow a cold that does not get better or that gets worse after 7 to 10 days. Symptoms include: Bad breath or loss of smell Cough, often worse at night Fatigue and general feeling of being ill Fever Headache Pressure-like pain, pain behind the eyes, toothache , or tenderness of the face Nasal stuffiness and discharge Sore throat and postnasal drip Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are the same as those of acute sinusitis. However, the symptoms tend to be milder and last longer than 12 weeks. Symptoms of sinusitis in children include: Cold or respiratory illness that has been getting better and then begins to get worse High fever, along with a darkened nasal discharge, that lasts for at least 3 days Nasal discharge, with or without a cough, that has been present for more than 10 days and is not improving",,Acute sinusitis; Sinus infection; Sinusitis - acute; Sinusitis - chronic; Rhinosinusitis

Sleep disorders,"Sleep disorders are problems with sleeping. These include trouble falling or staying asleep, falling asleep at the wrong times, too much sleep, and abnormal behaviors during sleep.","There are more than 100 different sleeping and waking disorders. They can be grouped into four main categories: Problems falling or staying asleep (insomnia) Problems staying awake (excessive daytime sleepiness) Problems sticking to a regular sleep schedule (sleep rhythm problem) Unusual behaviors during sleep (sleep-disruptive behaviors) PROBLEMS FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP Insomnia includes trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Episodes may come and go, last up to 3 weeks (be short-term), or be long-lasting (chronic). PROBLEMS STAYING AWAKE Hypersomnia is a condition in which people have excessive daytime sleepiness. This means they feel tired during the day and are prone to falling asleep. Hypersomnia can also include situations in which a person needs to sleep a lot. This may be due to other medical conditions, but can also be due to a problem in the brain. Causes of this problem include: Medical conditions, such as fibromyalgia and low thyroid function Medicines that are sedating Mononucleosis or other viral illnesses Narcolepsy and other sleep disorders Obesity, especially if it causes obstructive sleep apnea When no cause for the sleepiness can be found, it is called idiopathic hypersomnia . PROBLEMS STICKING TO A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE Problems may also occur when you do not stick to a regular sleep and wake schedule. This occurs when people travel between time zones. It can also occur with shift workers who are on changing schedules, especially nighttime workers. Disorders that involve a disrupted sleep schedule include: Irregular sleep-wake syndrome Jet lag syndrome Shift work sleep disorder Delayed sleep phase, as in teenagers who go to sleep very late at night and then sleep until noon Advanced sleep phase, as in older adults who go to sleep early in the evening and wake up very early SLEEP-DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORS Abnormal behaviors during sleep are called parasomnias. They are fairly common in children and include: Sleep terrors Sleepwalking REM sleep-behavior disorder (a person moves during REM sleep and may act out dreams)",,,Insomnia; Narcolepsy; Hypersomnia; Daytime sleepiness; Sleep rhythm; Sleep disruptive behaviors; Jet lag
Sleep disorders in older adults,"Sleep disorders in older adults involve any disrupted sleep pattern. This can include problems falling or staying asleep, too much sleep, or abnormal behaviors with sleep.","Sleep problems are common in older adults. The amount of sleep needed stays constant throughout the adult years. Doctors recommend that adults get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. In older adults, sleep is less deep and choppier than sleep in younger people. A healthy 70-year-old may wake up several times during the night without it being due to disease. Sleep disturbances in older adults may be due to any of the following: Alzheimer disease Alcohol use Changes in the body's natural internal clock, causing some people to fall asleep earlier in the evening Long-term (chronic) disease, such as heart failure Certain medicines, herbs, supplements, and recreational drugs Depression (depression is a common cause of sleep problems in people of all ages) Brain and nervous system conditions Not being very active Pain caused by diseases such as arthritis Stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine The need to urinate at night ( nocturia )","Symptoms that may occur include: Difficulty falling asleep Difficulty telling the difference between night and day Early morning awakening Waking up often during the night (for example, due to nocturia)",,Insomnia - older adults

The exact cause of sleep paralysis is not fully known. Research shows the following are linked to sleep paralysis: Not getting enough sleep Having an irregular sleep schedule, such as with shift workers Mental stress Sleeping on your back Certain medical problems can be associated with sleep paralysis: Sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy Some mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder , post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder Use of certain medicines, such as for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) Substance use Sleep paralysis that is not related to a medical problem is known as isolated sleep paralysis.","The normal sleep cycle has stages, from light drowsiness to deep sleep. During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, your eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common. Each night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. During REM sleep, your body is relaxed and your muscles don't move. Sleep paralysis occurs when the sleep cycle is shifting between stages. When you wake up suddenly from REM, your brain is awake, but your body is still in REM mode and can't move, causing you to feel like you're paralyzed. Episodes of sleep paralysis last from a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes. These spells end on their own or when you are touched or moved. In rare cases, you can have dream-like sensations or hallucinations , which may be scary.",,Parasomnia - sleep paralysis; Isolated sleep paralysis
Sleeping sickness,Sleeping sickness is an infection caused by tiny parasites carried by certain flies. It results in swelling of the brain.,"Sleeping sickness is caused by two types of parasites Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense . T b rhodesiense causes the more severe form of the illness. Tsetse flies carry the infection. When an infected fly bites you, the infection spreads through your bloodstream. Risk factors include living in parts of Africa where the disease is found and being bitten by tsetse flies. The disease does not occur in the United States, but travelers who have visited or lived in Africa can get infected.","General symptoms include: Mood changes, anxiety Fever, sweating Headache Weakness Insomnia at night Sleepiness during the day (may be uncontrollable) Swollen lymph nodes all over the body Swollen, red, painful nodule at site of the fly bite",,Parasite infection - human African trypanosomiasis
Sleepwalking,Sleepwalking is a disorder that occurs when people walk or do other activity while they are still asleep.,"The normal sleep cycle has stages, from light drowsiness to deep sleep. During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common. Each night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) most often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep (called N3 sleep) early in the night. Sleepwalking is much more common in children and young adults than in older adults. This is because as people age, they have less N3 sleep. Sleepwalking tends to run in families. Fatigue, lack of sleep, and anxiety are all associated with sleepwalking. In adults, sleepwalking may occur due to: Alcohol, sedatives, or other medicines, such as some sleeping pills Medical conditions, such as seizures Mental disorders In older adults, sleepwalking may be a symptom of a medical problem that causes decreased mental function neurocognitive disorder .","When people sleepwalk, they may sit up and look as though they are awake when they are actually asleep. They may get up and walk around. Or they may do complex activities such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, and dressing or undressing. Some people even drive a car while they are asleep. The episode can be very brief (a few seconds or minutes) or it can last for 30 minutes or longer. Most episodes last for less than 10 minutes. If they are not disturbed, sleepwalkers will go back to sleep. But they may fall asleep in a different or even unusual place. Symptoms of sleepwalking include: Acting confused or disoriented when the person wakes up Aggressive behavior when woken up by someone else Having a blank look on the face Opening eyes during sleep Not remembering the sleep walking episode when they wake up Performing detailed activity of any type during sleep Sitting up and appearing awake during sleep Talking during sleep and saying things that do not make sense Walking during sleep",,Walking during sleep; Somnambulism

Slipping rib syndrome,Slipping rib syndrome refers to pain in your lower chest or upper abdomen which may be present when your lower ribs move a little more than normal.,"This syndrome usually occurs in the 8th to 10th ribs (also known as false ribs) at the lower part of your rib cage. These ribs are not connected to the chest bone (sternum). Fibrous tissue (ligaments), connect these ribs to each other to help keep them stable. The relative weakness in the ligaments can allow the ribs to move a little more than normal and cause pain. The condition can occur as a result of: Injury to the chest while playing contact sports such as football, ice hockey, wrestling, and rugby A fall or direct trauma to your chest Rapid twisting, pushing, or lifting motions, such as throwing a baseball or swimming When the ribs shift, they press on the surrounding muscles, nerves, and other tissues. This causes pain and inflammation in the area. Slipping rib syndrome can occur at any age, but it is more common in middle-aged adults. Females may be more affected than males.","The condition usually occurs on one side. Rarely, it may occur on both sides. Symptoms include: Severe pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth,Small bowel bacterial overgrowth is a condition in which very large numbers of bacteria grow in the small intestine.,"Most of the time, unlike the large intestine, the small intestine does not have a large number of bacteria. Excess bacteria in the small intestine may use up the nutrients needed by the body. As a result, a person may become malnourished . The breakdown of nutrients by the excess bacteria can also damage the lining of the small intestine. This can make it even harder for the body to absorb nutrients. Conditions that can lead to overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine include: Complications of diseases or surgery that create pouches or blockages in the small intestine. Crohn disease is one of these conditions. Diseases that lead to decreased movement of the small bowel, such as diabetes and scleroderma . Immunodeficiency, such as AIDS or immunoglobulin deficiency. Short bowel syndrome caused by surgical removal of the small intestine. Small bowel diverticulosis, in which small, or, at times, large sacs occur in the wall of the intestine. These sacs allow too many bacteria to grow. Surgical procedures that create a loop of small intestine where excess bacteria can grow. An example is a Billroth II type of stomach removal ( gastrectomy ). Some cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).",The most common symptoms are: Abdominal fullness Abdominal pain and cramps Bloating Diarrhea (most often watery) Gassiness Other symptoms may include: Fatty stool Weight loss,,Overgrowth - intestinal bacteria; Bacterial overgrowth - intestine; Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; SIBO

Small intestinal ischemia and infarction,Intestinal ischemia and infarction occurs when there is a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the arteries or veins that supply the small intestine.,"There are several possible causes of intestinal ischemia and infarction. Hernia -- If the intestine moves into the wrong place or becomes tangled, it can cut off the blood flow. Adhesions -- The intestine may become trapped in scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery. This can lead to loss of blood flow if left untreated. Embolus -- Blood clots can block one of the arteries supplying the intestine. People who have had a heart attack or who have heart arrhythmias , such as atrial fibrillation , are at risk for this problem. Narrowing of the arteries -- The arteries that supply blood to the intestine may become narrowed or blocked from cholesterol buildup. When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack. When it happens in the arteries to the intestine, it causes intestinal ischemia. Narrowing of the veins -- The veins carrying blood away from the intestine may become blocked by blood clots. This blocks blood flow in the intestine. This is more common in people with liver disease, cancer, or blood clotting disorders. Low blood pressure -- Very low blood pressure in people who already have narrowing of the intestinal arteries may also cause loss of blood flow to the intestine. This often occurs in people with other serious medical problems.","The main symptom of intestinal ischemia is pain in abdomen. The pain is severe, even though the area is not very tender when touched.

Smallpox,Smallpox is a serious disease that is easily passed from person to person (contagious). It is caused by a virus.,"Smallpox spreads from one person to another from saliva droplets. It may also be spread from bed sheets and clothing. It is most contagious during the first week of the infection. It may continue to be contagious until the scabs from the rash fall off. The virus can stay alive between 6 and 24 hours. People were once vaccinated against this disease. However, the disease has been eradicated since 1979. The United States stopped giving the smallpox vaccine in 1972. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that all countries stop vaccinating for smallpox. There are two forms of smallpox: Variola major is a serious illness that can be life threatening in people who have not been vaccinated. It was responsible for a large number of deaths. Variola minor is a milder infection that rarely causes death. A massive program by the WHO wiped out all known smallpox viruses from the world in the 1970s, except for a few samples saved for government research and presumed bioweapons. Researchers continue to debate whether or not to kill the last remaining samples of the virus or to preserve it in case there may be some future reason to study it. You are more likely to develop smallpox if you: Are a laboratory worker who handles the virus (rare) Are in a location where the virus was released as a biological weapon It is unknown how long past vaccinations stay effective. People who received the vaccine many years ago may no longer be fully protected against the virus. THE RISK OF TERRORISM There is a concern that the smallpox virus could be spread as part of a terrorist attack. The virus could be spread in spray (aerosol) form.","Symptoms most often occur about 12 to 14 days after you have been infected with the virus.

If you lose your sense of smell, you may have changes in taste. Adding highly seasoned foods to your diet can help stimulate the taste sensations that you still have. Improve your safety at home by using smoke detectors and electric appliances instead of gas appliances. You may not be able to smell gas if there is a leak. Or, install equipment that detects gas fumes in the home. People with smell loss should label when food items were opened to prevent eating spoiled food.

This is when people are overly anxious about becoming sick or developing a serious disease. They fully expect they will become very ill at some point. Unlike SSD, with illness anxiety disorder, there are few or no actual physical symptoms.","Physical symptoms that can occur with SSD may include: Pain Fatigue or weakness Shortness of breath Symptoms may be mild to severe. There may be one or more symptoms. They may come and go or change over time. Symptoms may be due to a medical condition but they also may have no clear cause. How people feel and behave in response to these physical sensations are the main symptoms of SSD. These reactions must persist for 6 months or more. People with SSD may: Feel extreme anxiety about symptoms Feel concern that mild symptoms are a sign of serious disease Go to the provider for multiple tests and procedures, but not believe the results if they are normal Feel that the provider does not take their symptoms seriously enough or has not done a good job treating the problem Spend a lot of time and energy dealing with health concerns Have trouble functioning because of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about symptoms",,Somatic symptom and related disorders; Somatization disorder; Somatoform disorders; Briquet syndrome; Illness anxiety disorder

Spasmodic dysphonia,Spasmodic dysphonia is difficulty speaking due to spasms (dystonia) of the muscles that control the vocal cords.,"The exact cause of spasmodic dysphonia is unknown. Sometimes it is triggered by psychological stress. Most cases result from a problem in the brain and nervous system that can affect the voice. The vocal cord muscles spasm, or contract, which causes the vocal cords to get too close or too far apart while a person is using their voice, making it sound normal. Spasmodic dysphonia often occurs between ages 30 and 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men. Sometimes, the condition runs in the family.","The voice is usually hoarse or grating. It may waver and pause. The voice may sound strained or strangled, and it may seem as if the speaker has to use extra effort. This is known as adductor dysphonia. Sometimes, the voice is whispery or breathy. This is known as abductor dysphonia. The problem may go away when the person laughs, whispers, speaks in a high-pitched voice, sings, or shouts. Some people may also have muscle tone problems in other parts of the body, such as writer's cramp.",,Dysphonia - spasmodic; Speech disorder - spasmodic dysphonia
Spasmus nutans,"Spasmus nutans is a disorder affecting infants and young children. It involves rapid, uncontrolled eye movements, head bobbing, and sometimes, holding the neck in an abnormal position.","Most cases of spasmus nutans begin between age 6 months and 1 year. It usually lasts about 2 years but can go on as long as 5 years. The cause is unknown, although it may be associated with other medical conditions. A link with iron or vitamin D deficiency has been suggested. In very rare cases, symptoms similar to spasmus nutans may be due to certain types of brain tumors or other serious conditions.","Symptoms of spasmus nutans include: Small, quick, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus (both eyes are involved, but each eye may move differently) Head nodding Head tilting",,
Spasticity,"Spasticity is stiff or rigid muscles. It may also be called unusual tightness or increased muscle tone. Reflexes (for example, a knee-jerk reflex) are stronger or exaggerated. The condition can interfere with walking, movement, speech, and many other activities of daily living.","Spasticity may be caused by any of the following: Brain damage caused by lack of oxygen, as can occur in near drowning or near suffocation Cerebral palsy (group of disorders due to brain injury at birth) Cervical spinal stenosis Head injury Infections of brain or spinal cord (Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, tuberculosis) Multiple sclerosis Neurodegenerative illness (illnesses that damage the brain and nervous system over time) Phenylketonuria (disorder in which the body can't break down the amino acid phenylalanine) Spinal cord injury Stroke Tumors in brain or spinal cord Toxins (nitrous oxide or ""laughing gas"") Vitamin or mineral deficiency (vitamin B12, vitamin E, copper) This list does not include all conditions that can cause spasticity.",,"Exercise, including muscle stretching, can help make symptoms less severe.

Speech disorders - children,A speech disorder is a condition in which a person has problems creating or forming the speech sounds needed to communicate with others. This can make the person's speech difficult to understand.,"Speech is one of the main ways in which we communicate with those around us. It develops naturally, along with other signs of normal growth and development . Disorders of speech and language are common in preschool age children. Disfluencies are disorders in which a person repeats a sound, word, or phrase. Stuttering may be the most serious disfluency. It may be caused by: Genetic abnormalities Emotional stress Any trauma to the brain or infection Articulation and phonological disorders may occur in other family members. Other causes include: Problems or changes in the structure or shape of the muscles and bones used to make speech sounds. These changes may include cleft palate and tooth problems. Damage to parts of the brain or the nerves (such as from cerebral palsy ) that control how the muscles work together to create speech. Hearing loss. Voice disorders are caused by problems when air passes from the lungs, through the vocal cords, and then through the throat, nose, mouth, and lips. A voice disorder may be due to: Acid from the stomach moving upward ( GERD ) Cancer of the throat Cleft palate or other problems with the palate Conditions that damage the nerves that supply the muscles of the vocal cords Laryngeal webs or clefts (a birth defect in which a thin layer of tissue is between the vocal cords) Noncancerous growths (polyps, nodules, cysts, granulomas, papillomas, or ulcers) on the vocal cords Overuse of the vocal cords from screaming, constantly clearing the throat, or singing Hearing loss","DISFLUENCY Stuttering is the most common type of disfluency. Symptoms of disfluency can include: Repetition of sounds, words, or parts of words or phrases after age 4 (I want...I want my doll. I...I see you.) Putting in (interjecting) extra sounds or words (We went to the...uh...store.) Making words longer (I am Boooobbby Jones.) Pausing during a sentence or words, often with the lips together Tension in the voice or sounds Frustration with attempts to communicate Head jerking while talking Eye blinking while talking Embarrassment with speech ARTICULATION DISORDER The child is not able to produce speech sounds clearly, such as saying ""coo"" instead of ""school."" Certain sounds (like ""r"", ""l"", or ""s"") may be consistently distorted or changed (such as making the 's' sound with a whistle). Errors may make it hard for people to understand the person (only family members may be able to understand a child). PHONOLOGICAL DISORDER The child does not use some or all of the speech sounds to form words as expected for their age. The last or first sound of words (most often consonants) may be left out or changed. The child may have no problem pronouncing the same sound in other words (a child may say ""boo"" for ""book"" and ""pi"" for ""pig"", but may have no problem saying ""key"" or ""go""). VOICE DISORDERS Other speech problems include: Hoarseness or raspiness to the voice Voice may break in or out Pitch of the voice may change suddenly Voice may be too loud or too soft Person may run out of air during a sentence Speech may sound odd because too much air is escaping through the nose (hypernasality) or too little air is coming out through the nose (hyponasality)",,Articulation deficiency; Articulation disorder; Phonological disorder; Voice disorders; Vocal disorders; Disfluency; Communication disorder - speech disorder; Speech disorder - stuttering; Cluttering; Stammering; Childhood onset fluency disorder
Speech impairment in adults,Speech and language impairment may be any of several problems that make it difficult to communicate.,"Some of these disorders develop gradually, but anyone can develop a speech and language impairment suddenly, usually due to a stroke or trauma. In some cases, people may have both aphasia and dysarthria. APHASIA Alzheimer disease Brain tumor (more common in aphasia than dysarthria) Dementia Head trauma Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) DYSARTHRIA Alcohol intoxication Dementia Diseases that affect nerves and muscles (neuromuscular diseases), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig disease), cerebral palsy , myasthenia gravis , or multiple sclerosis (MS) Facial trauma Facial weakness, such as Bell's palsy or tongue weakness Head trauma Head and neck cancer surgery Nervous system (neurological) disorders that affect the brain, such as Parkinson disease or Huntington disease (more common in dysarthria than aphasia) Poorly fitting dentures Side effects of medicines that act on the central nervous system, such as narcotics, phenytoin, or carbamazepine Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA) VOICE DISTURBANCES Growths or nodules on the vocal cords People who use their voice heavily (teachers, coaches, vocal performers) are more likely to develop voice disorders.",,"For dysarthria, ways to help improve communication include speaking slowly and using hand gestures. Family and friends need to provide plenty of time for those with dysarthria to express themselves. Typing on an electronic device or using pen and paper can also help with communication. People with aphasia or dysarthria may benefit from speech therapy. For aphasia, family members may need to provide frequent orientation reminders, such as the day of the week. Disorientation and confusion often occur with aphasia. Using nonverbal ways of communicating may also help. It's important to maintain a relaxed, calm environment and keep external stimuli to a minimum. Speak in a normal tone of voice (this condition is not a hearing or emotional problem). Use simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings. Don't assume that the person understands. Provide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition. Mental health counseling may help with depression or frustration that many people with speech impairment have.",Language impairment; Impairment of speech; Inability to speak; Aphasia; Dysarthria; Slurred speech; Dysphonia voice disorders
Spider angioma,Spider angioma is an abnormal collection of blood vessels near the surface of the skin.,"Spider angiomas are very common. They often occur in pregnant women and in people with liver disease. They can appear in both children and adults. They get their name because the mark looks similar to a red spider. They appear most often on the face, neck, upper part of the trunk, arms, and fingers.","The main symptom is a blood vessel spot that: May have a red dot in the center Has reddish extensions that reach out from the center Disappears when pressed on and comes back when pressure is released In rare cases, bleeding occurs in a spider angioma.",,Nevus araneus; Spider telangiectasia; Vascular spider; Spider nevus; Arterial spiders

Spinal cord abscess,Spinal cord abscess is the swelling and irritation (inflammation) and the collection of infected material (pus) and germs in or around the spinal cord.,"A spinal cord abscess is caused by an infection inside the spine. An abscess of the spinal cord itself is very rare. A spinal abscess usually occurs as a complication of an epidural abscess . Pus forms as a collection of: White blood cells Fluid Live and dead bacteria or other microorganisms Destroyed tissue cells The pus is commonly covered by a lining or membrane that forms around the edges. The pus collection causes pressure on the spinal cord. The infection is usually due to bacteria. Often it is caused by a staphylococcus infection that spreads through the spine. It may be caused by tuberculosis in some areas of the world, but this is not as common today as it was in the past. In rare cases, the infection may be due to a fungus. The following increase your risk for a spinal cord abscess: Back injuries or trauma, including minor ones Boils on the skin, especially on the back or scalp (rare) Complication of lumbar puncture or back surgery Spread of any infection through the bloodstream from another part of the body ( bacteremia ) Injecting drugs The infection often begins in the bone ( osteomyelitis ). The bone infection may cause an epidural abscess to form. This abscess gets larger and presses on the spinal cord. The infection can spread to the cord itself. A spinal cord abscess is rare. When it does occur, it can be life threatening.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Fever and chills. Loss of bladder or bowel control. Loss of movement of an area of the body below the abscess. Loss of sensation of an area of the body below the abscess. Low backache, often mild, but slowly gets worse, with pain moving to the hip, leg, or feet. Or, pain may spread to the shoulder, arm, or hand.",,Abscess - spinal cord

Spinal cord trauma,"Spinal cord trauma is damage to the spinal cord. It may result from direct injury to the cord itself or indirectly from disease of the nearby bones, tissues, or blood vessels.","The spinal cord contains nerve fibers and cells. These nerve fibers carry messages between your brain and body. The spinal cord is located in the spinal canal of your spine in your neck, chest, and back down to the first lumbar vertebra. Spinal cord injury (SCI) can be caused by any of the following: Assault Falls Gunshot wounds Industrial accidents Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) Diving Sports injuries A minor injury can damage the spinal cord. Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , infection, cancer, or osteoporosis can weaken the spine, which normally protects the spinal cord. Injury can also occur if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow ( spinal stenosis ). This occurs due to osteoarthritis of spine joints, usually in older people. Direct injury or damage to the spinal cord can occur due to: Bruises if the bones have been weakened, loosened, or fractured Disc herniation (when the disc pushes against the spinal cord) Fragments of bone (such as from broken vertebrae, which are the spine bones) in the spinal cord Fragments of metal (such as from a motor vehicle collision or gunshot) Compression from twisting of the head, neck or back during an accident such as a slip and fall, or intense chiropractic manipulation Tight spinal canal (spinal stenosis) that squeezes the spinal cord When the spine is out of alignment Bleeding, fluid buildup, infection, and swelling can occur inside the spinal canal. This can press on the spinal cord and damage it. Most high impact SCIs, such as from MVCs or sports injuries, are seen in healthy people. Most low impact SCIs, such as a slip and fall, occur in older individuals with spinal stenosis. Most of these people were not aware they had spinal stenosis. Risk factors include: Participating in risky physical activities Riding in or on high-speed vehicles Diving into shallow water","Symptoms vary, depending on the location of the injury. SCI causes weakness and loss of feeling at, and below the injury. The severity of the symptoms depends on whether the entire cord is injured (complete) or only partially injured (incomplete). An injury to the upper (cervical) spinal cord will result in weakness or paralysis of the arms and legs. An injury to the middle (thoracic) spinal cord will result in weakness of the legs only. An injury below the first lumbar vertebra does not cause SCI because the spinal cord turns into a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina. But such an injury may cause cauda equina syndrome, which is an injury to these nerve roots. Many SCIs and cauda equina syndrome cases are emergencies and need surgery right away. Injuries of the spinal cord at any level may cause: Increased muscle tone (spasticity) Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms) Numbness Sensory changes Pain Weakness, paralysis Difficulty breathing because of weakness of the abdominal, diaphragm, or intercostal (rib) muscles CERVICAL (NECK) INJURIES When SCIs are in the neck area, symptoms can affect the arms, legs, and middle of the body. The symptoms: May occur on one or both sides of the body Can include severe breathing problems from paralysis of the breathing muscles if the injury is high up in the neck THORACIC (CHEST LEVEL) INJURIES When SCIs are at chest level, symptoms can affect the legs. Injuries to the cervical or high thoracic spinal cord may also result in: Blood pressure problems (too high and too low) Abnormal sweating Trouble maintaining normal temperature LUMBAR OR SACRAL (LOWER BACK) INJURIES When SCIs are at the lower back level, symptoms can affect one or both legs. Muscles that control the bowels and bladder can also be affected. Spine injuries can damage the spinal cord if they are at the upper portion of the lumbar spine or the lumbar and sacral nerve roots (cauda equina) if they are at the lower lumbar spine.",,Spinal cord injury; Compression of spinal cord; SCI; Cord compression

Spinal muscular atrophy,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of disorders of the motor neurons (motor cells). These disorders are passed down through families (inherited) and can appear at any stage of life. The disorder leads to muscle weakness and atrophy.,"SMA is a collection of different motor nerve (or neuron) diseases. The disease is caused by a lack of a protein (SMN) due to defective genes. Most of the time, a person must get one copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected. The most severe form is SMA type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Infants with SMA type II have less severe symptoms during early infancy, but they become weaker with time. SMA type III is a less severe form of the disease. In rare cases, SMA begins in adulthood. This is the mildest form of the disease. A family history of SMA in an immediate family member (such as brother or sister) is a risk factor for all types of the disorder.","Symptoms of SMA may vary depending on the SMA type. Infants with SMA type I are born with very little muscle tone, weak muscles, and feeding and breathing problems. In infants with SMA type II, symptoms may not appear until age 6 months to 2 years. Type III SMA is a milder disease that starts in childhood or adolescence and slowly gets worse. Type IV is even milder, with weakness starting in adulthood. Often, weakness is first felt in the shoulder and leg muscles. Weakness gets worse over time and eventually becomes severe. Symptoms in an infant: Breathing difficulty with shortness of breath and labored breathing, leading to a lack of oxygen Feeding difficulty (food may go into the windpipe instead of the stomach) Floppy infant (poor muscle tone) Lack of head control Little movement Weakness that gets worse Symptoms in a child: Frequent, increasingly severe respiratory infections Nasal speech Posture that gets worse With SMA, the nerves that control feeling (sensory nerves) are not affected. So, a person with the disease can feel things normally.",,Werdnig-Hoffmann disease; Kugelberg-Welander disease
Spinal stenosis,"Spinal stenosis is narrowing of the spinal column that causes pressure on the spinal cord, or narrowing of the openings (called neural foramina) where spinal nerves leave the spinal column.","Spinal stenosis usually occurs as a person ages, however, some patients are born with less space for their spinal cord. The spinal disks become drier and start to bulge and can rupture. The bones and ligaments of the spine thicken or grow larger. This is caused by arthritis or long-term swelling. Spinal stenosis may also be caused by: Arthritis of the spine, usually in middle-aged or older people Bone diseases, such as Paget disease Defect or growth in the spine that was present from birth Narrow spinal canal that the person was born with Herniated or slipped disk, which often may have happened in the past Injury that causes pressure on the nerve roots or the spinal cord Tumors in the spine Fracture or injury of a spinal bone","Symptoms often get worse slowly over time. Most often, symptoms will be on one side of the body, but may involve both legs. Symptoms include: Numbness , cramping, or pain in the back, buttocks, thighs, or calves, or in the neck, shoulders, or arms Weakness of part of a leg or arm Symptoms are more likely to be present or get worse when you stand or walk. They often lessen or disappear when you sit down or lean forward. Most people with spinal stenosis cannot walk for a long period without having significant pain.

Prostate , lung , and breast cancers Leukemia : a blood cancer that starts in the white cells in the bone marrow Lymphoma : a cancer of the lymph tissue Myeloma : a blood cancer that starts in the plasma cells of the bone marrow The cause of primary spinal tumors is unknown. Some primary spinal tumors occur with certain inherited gene mutations. Spinal tumors can be located: Inside the spinal cord (intramedullary) In the membranes (meninges) covering the spinal cord (extramedullary - intradural) Between the meninges and bones of the spine (extradural) In the spine bones (vertebrae) As it grows, the tumor can affect the: Blood vessels Bones of the spine Meninges Nerve roots Spinal cord cells The tumor may press on the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing damage. With time, the damage may become permanent.","The symptoms depend on the location, type of tumor, and your general health. Secondary tumors that have spread to the spine from another site (metastatic tumors) often progress quickly. Primary tumors often progress slowly over weeks to years. Symptoms may include: Abnormal sensations or loss of sensation, especially in the legs Back pain that gets worse over time, is often in the middle or lower back, is usually severe and not relieved by pain medicine, gets worse when lying down or straining (such as during a cough or sneeze), and may extend to the hips or legs Loss of bowel control , bladder leakage Muscle contractions, twitches, or spasms (fasciculations) Muscle weakness (decreased muscle strength) in the legs that causes falls, makes walking difficult, and may get worse (progressive) and lead to paralysis",,Tumor - spinal cord

Spondylolisthesis,Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which a bone (vertebra) in the spine moves forward out of the proper position onto the bone below it.,"In children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the lower back (lumbar vertebra) and the first bone in the sacrum (pelvis) area. It is often due to a birth defect in that area of the spine or sudden injury (acute trauma). In adults, the most common cause is abnormal wear on the cartilage and bones, such as arthritis . The condition mostly affects people over 50 years old. It is more common in women than in men. Bone disease and fractures can also cause spondylolisthesis. Certain sports activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting, and football, greatly stress the bones in the lower back. They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch (hyperextend) the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra. A stress fracture can cause a spinal bone to become weak and shift out of place.","Symptoms of spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. A person with spondylolisthesis may have no symptoms. Children may not show symptoms until they're 18 years old. The condition can lead to increased and abnormal lordosis (also called swayback). In later stages, it may result in kyphosis (roundback) as the upper spine falls off the lower spine. Symptoms may include any of the following: Lower back pain Muscle tightness (tight hamstring muscle) Pain, numbness, or tingling in the thighs and buttocks Stiffness Tenderness in the area of the vertebra that is out of place Weakness in the legs",,Low back pain - spondylolisthesis; LBP - spondylolisthesis; Lumbar pain - spondylolisthesis; Degenerative spine - spondylolisthesis

Sporotrichosis,Sporotrichosis is a long-term (chronic) skin infection that is caused by a fungus called Sporothrix schenckii.,"Sporothrix schenckii is found in plants. Infection commonly occurs when the skin is broken while handling plant material such as rosebushes, briars, or dirt that contains a lot of mulch. Sporotrichosis can be a job-related disease for people who work with plants, such as farmers, horticulturists, rose gardeners, and plant nursery workers. Widespread (disseminated) sporotrichosis can develop in people with a weakened immune system when they inhale dust filled with spores of the fungus.","Symptoms include a small, painless, red lump that develops at the site of infection. As time passes, this lump will turn into an ulcer (sore). The lump may develop up to 3 months after an injury. Most sores are on the hands and forearms because these areas are commonly injured when handling plants. The fungus follows the channels in your body's lymph system. Small ulcers appear as lines on the skin as the infection moves up an arm or leg. These sores do not heal unless they are treated, and they may last for years. The sores may sometimes drain small amounts of pus. Body-wide ( systemic ) sporotrichosis can cause lung and breathing problems, bone infection, arthritis, and infection of the nervous system.",,

Squamous cell skin cancer,Squamous cell skin cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the United States.,"Squamous cell skin cancer affects the epidermis, the top layer of skin. Squamous cell cancer may occur in undamaged skin. It can also occur in skin that has been injured or inflamed. Most squamous cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation. The earliest form of squamous cell cancer is called Bowen disease (or squamous cell carcinoma in situ). This type does not spread to nearby tissues, because it is still in the outermost layer of the skin. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin lesion that may become a squamous cell cancer. (A lesion is a problem area of the skin.) A keratoacanthoma is a mild type of squamous cell cancer that grows rapidly. Risks of squamous cell cancer include: Having light-colored skin, blue or green eyes, or blond or red hair. Long-term, daily sun exposure (such as in people who work outside). Many severe sunburns early in life. Older age. Having had many x-rays. Chemical exposure, such as arsenic. A weakened immune system, especially in people who have had an organ transplant.","Squamous cell cancer usually occurs on the face, ears, neck, hands, or arms. It may occur in other areas. The main symptom is a growing bump that may have a rough, scaly surface and flat reddish patches. The earliest form (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) can appear as a scaly, crusted, and large reddish patch that can be larger than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters).

Stable angina,Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that most often occurs with activity or emotional stress. Angina is due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels in the heart called the coronary arteries.,"Your heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen. The coronary arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart. When the heart muscle has to work harder, it needs more oxygen. Symptoms of angina may occur when blood supply to the heart muscle is reduced. This happens when the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis or by a blood clot.

This means that the same amount of exercise or activity may cause your angina to occur. Your angina should improve or go away when you stop or slow down the exercise. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left of it. The pain of stable angina most often begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away. Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the: Arm (most often the left) Back Jaw Neck Shoulder Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion .

Strabismus,"Strabismus is a disorder in which both eyes do not line up in the same direction. Therefore, they do not look at the same object at the same time. The most common form of strabismus is known as ""crossed eyes.""","Six different muscles surround each eye and work ""as a team."" This allows both eyes to focus on the same object. In someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and looks at another object. When this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain. In children, the brain may learn to ignore (suppress) the image from the weaker eye. If the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called amblyopia . Another name for amblyopia is ""lazy eye."" Sometimes lazy eye is present first, and it causes strabismus. In most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. In more than one half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth. This is called congenital strabismus. Most of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength. Other disorders associated with strabismus in children include: Apert syndrome Cerebral palsy Congenital rubella Hemangioma near the eye during infancy Incontinentia pigmenti syndrome Noonan syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome Retinopathy of prematurity Retinoblastoma Traumatic brain injury Trisomy 18 Strabismus that develops in adults can be caused by: Botulism Diabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus) Graves disease Guillain-Barré syndrome Injury to the eye Shellfish poisoning Stroke Traumatic brain injury Vision loss from any eye disease or injury A family history of strabismus is a risk factor. Farsightedness may be a contributing factor, often in children. Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus.",Symptoms of strabismus may be present all the time or may come and go. Symptoms can include: Crossed eyes Double vision Eyes that do not aim in the same direction Uncoordinated eye movements (eyes do not move together) Loss of vision or depth perception It is important to note that children may never be aware of double vision.

Stroke,"A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops. A stroke is sometimes called a ""brain attack.""","There are two major types of stroke: Ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways: A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke . A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke. Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries. Watch this video about: Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include: Aneurysm (weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out) Arteriovenous malformation (AVM; abnormal connection between the arteries and veins) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin (Coumadin) or has a bleeding disorder. Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes . Other major risk factors are: Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation Diabetes Family history of stroke Being male High cholesterol Increasing age, especially after age 55 Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke) Obesity History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time) Stroke risk is also higher in: People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, excessive use of alcohol, use recreational drugs, a high-fat diet, or lack of exercise People who have a hereditary tendency to develop blood clots Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35) Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant Women who take hormone replacement therapy Patent foramen ovale (PFO) , a hole between the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart","Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred. Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse. A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache: Starts suddenly and may be severe May be worse when you are lying flat May wake you up from sleep May get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma) Changes in hearing or taste Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures Confusion or loss of memory Problems swallowing Problems writing or reading Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo) Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking",,Cerebrovascular disease; CVA; Cerebral infarction; Cerebral hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke; Stroke - ischemic; Cerebrovascular accident; Stroke - hemorrhagic; Carotid artery - stroke

They then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. From the stomach, the worms move to the small intestine, where they attach to the intestinal wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae (immature worms) and pass out of the body. Unlike other worms, these larvae can re-enter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin can become red and painful. This infection is uncommon in the United States, but it does occur in the southeastern US. Most cases in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa. Some people are at risk for a severe type called strongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome. In this form of the condition, there are more worms and they multiply more quickly than normal. It can occur in people who have a weakened immune system. This includes people who have had an organ or blood-product transplant, people with HIV/AIDS, and those who take steroid medicine or immune-suppressing drugs.","Most of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include: Abdominal pain (upper abdomen) Cough Diarrhea Rash Red hive-like areas near the anus Vomiting Weight loss Fever",,Intestinal parasite - strongyloidiasis; Roundworm - strongyloidiasis
Stuffy or runny nose – adult,A stuffy or congested nose occurs when the tissues lining it become swollen.

Sturge-Weber syndrome,Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare disorder that is present at birth. A child with this condition will have a port-wine stain birthmark (usually on the face) and may have nervous system problems.,"In many people, the cause of Sturge-Weber is due to a variation of the GNAQ gene. This gene affects small blood vessels called capillaries in some but not all body cells. Problems in the capillaries cause the port-wine stains to form. Sturge-Weber is not thought to be passed down (inherited) through families.",Symptoms of SWS include: Port-wine stain (more common on the upper face and eyelid than the rest of the body) Seizures Headache Paralysis or weakness on one side Learning disabilities Glaucoma (very high fluid pressure in the eye) Low thyroid function ( hypothyroidism ),,Encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis; SWS
Stuttering,"Stuttering is a speech disorder in which sounds, syllables, or words are repeated or last longer than normal. These problems cause a break in the flow of speech called disfluency.","Stuttering usually affects children ages 2 to 5 years and is more common in boys. It may last for several weeks to several years. For a small number of children, stuttering does not go away and may get worse. This is called developmental stuttering and it is the most common type of stuttering. Stuttering tends to run in families. Genes that cause stuttering have been identified. There is also evidence that stuttering may be a result of brain injuries, such as stroke or traumatic brain injuries. In rare cases, stuttering is caused by emotional trauma (called psychogenic stuttering). Stuttering persists into adulthood more in boys than in girls.","Stuttering may start with repeating consonants (k, g, t). If stuttering becomes worse, words and phrases are repeated. Later, vocal spasms develop. There is a forced, almost explosive sound to speech. The person may appear to be struggling to speak. Stressful social situations and anxiety can make symptoms worse. Symptoms of stuttering may include: Feeling frustrated when trying to communicate Pausing or hesitating when starting or during sentences, phrases, or words, often with the lips together Putting in (interjecting) extra sounds or words (""We went to the...uh...store"") Repeating sounds, words, parts of words, or phrases (""I want...I want my doll,"" ""I...I see you,"" or ""Ca-ca-ca-can"") Tension in the voice Very long sounds within words (""I am Booooobbbby Jones"" or ""Llllllllike"") Other symptoms that might be seen with stuttering include: Eye blinking Jerking of the head or other body parts Jaw jerking Clenching fist Children with mild stuttering are often unaware of their stuttering. In severe cases, children may be more aware. Facial movements, anxiety, and increased stuttering may occur when they are asked to speak. Some people who stutter find that they do not stutter when they read aloud or sing.",,Children and stuttering; Speech disfluency; Stammering; Childhood onset fluency disorder; Cluttering; Physical concomitants
Subacute combined degeneration,"Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) is a disorder of the spine, brain, and nerves. It causes weakness, abnormal sensations, mental problems, and vision difficulties.","SCD is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. It mainly affects the spinal cord. But its effects on the brain and the peripheral (body) nerves are the reason for the term ""combined."" At first, the nerve covering (myelin sheath) is damaged. Later, the entire nerve cell is affected. Doctors do not know exactly how a lack of vitamin B12 damages the nerves. It is possible that the lack of this vitamin causes abnormal fatty acids to form around cells and nerves. People are at high risk for this condition if vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed from their intestine or if they have: Pernicious anemia , a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells due to vitamin B12 deficiency Disorders of the small intestine, including Crohn disease Problems absorbing nutrients, which can occur after gastrointestinal surgery, including weight loss surgery Use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas), especially if used as a recreational drug","Symptoms include: Abnormal sensations (tingling and numbness) Weakness of the legs, arms, or other areas These symptoms slowly get worse and are usually felt on both sides of the body. As the disease worsens, symptoms may include any of the following: Clumsiness , stiff or awkward movements. Mental changes, which can range from mild memory problems, irritability, apathy, and confusion, to severe dementia and psychosis. Severe dementia is uncommon, but in some cases it's the first symptom of the disorder. Decreased vision. Depression . Sleepiness. Unsteady gait and loss of balance.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, disabling, and deadly brain disorder related to measles (rubeola) infection.","Normally, the measles virus does not cause brain damage. However, an abnormal immune response to measles or, possibly, certain variant forms of the virus may cause severe illness and death. This response leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years. SSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is a rare disease. Very few cases are seen in the United States since the nationwide measles vaccination program began. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally occurs in children and adolescents.","Symptoms of SSPE occur in four general stages. With each stage, the symptoms are worse than the stage before: Stage I: There may be personality changes, mood swings, or depression . Fever and headache may also be present. This stage may last up to 6 months. Stage II: There may be uncontrolled movement problems including jerking and muscle spasms. Other symptoms that may occur in this stage are loss of vision, dementia , and seizures . Stage III: Jerking movements are replaced by writhing (twisting) movements and rigidity. Death may occur from complications. Stage IV: Areas of the brain that regulate breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage,Subconjunctival hemorrhage is a bright red patch appearing in the white of the eye. This condition is one of several disorders called red eye.,"The white of the eye (sclera) is covered with a thin layer of clear tissue called the bulbar conjunctiva . A subconjunctival hemorrhage occurs when a small blood vessel breaks open and bleeds within the conjunctiva. The blood is often very visible, but since it is confined within the conjunctiva, it does not move and cannot be wiped away. The problem may occur without injury. It is often first noticed when you wake up and look in a mirror. Some things that may cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage include: Sudden increases in pressure in the head or neck, such as violent sneezing or coughing Having high blood pressure or taking blood thinners Rubbing the eyes Viral infection Certain eye surgeries or injuries A subconjunctival hemorrhage is common in newborn infants.

Subdural hematoma,A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain.,"A subdural hematoma is most often the result of a severe head injury. This type of subdural hematoma is among the deadliest of all head injuries. The bleeding fills the brain area very rapidly, compressing brain tissue. This often results in brain injury and may lead to death. With any subdural hematoma, tiny veins between the surface of the brain and its outer covering (the dura) stretch and tear, allowing blood to collect. In older adults, the veins are often already stretched because of brain shrinkage (atrophy) and are more easily injured. A chronic subdural hematoma is more often seen in older adults. This type of subdural hematoma may be due to blood that persists after an acute injury or the result of slowly leaking blood. These can occur after a minor head injury and may go unnoticed for many days. Some subdural hematomas occur without cause (spontaneously). The following increase the risk for a subdural hematoma: Medicines that thin the blood (such as warfarin or aspirin) Long-term alcohol use Medical conditions that make your blood clot poorly Repeated head injury, such as from falls Very young or very old age In infants and young children, a subdural hematoma may occur after child abuse and are commonly seen in a condition called shaken baby syndrome .","Depending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur: Drowsiness, confusion, or coma Decreased memory Problem speaking or swallowing Problems with balance or walking Headache Seizures or loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Weakness or numbness of arms, legs, face Vision problems Behavioral changes or psychosis In infants, symptoms may include: Bulging fontanelles (the soft spots of the baby's skull) Separated sutures (the areas where growing skull bones join) Feeding problems Seizures High-pitched cry, irritability Increased head size (circumference) Increased sleepiness or lethargy Persistent vomiting",,Subdural hemorrhage; Traumatic brain injury - subdural hematoma; TBI - subdural hematoma; Head injury - subdural hematoma

Many who develop a substance use problem have depression , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or another mental health issue. A stressful or chaotic lifestyle and low self-esteem are also common. Children who grow up seeing their parents misuse substances may have a high risk of developing substance use problem later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons. Commonly used substances include: Opiates and other narcotics are powerful painkillers that can cause drowsiness, and sometimes intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy. These include heroin, opium, codeine, and narcotic pain medicines that may be prescribed by a health care provider or acquired illegally. Stimulants are substances that stimulate the brain and nervous system. They include cocaine , amphetamines , and some medicines used to treat ADHD (such as methylphenidate, or Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these substances over time to feel the same effect. Depressants cause drowsiness and reduce anxiety. They include alcohol , barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. Using these substances can lead to addiction. LSD , mescaline, psilocybin (""mushrooms""), and phencyclidine ( PCP , or ""angel dust"") can cause a person to see things that are not there ( hallucinations ) and can lead to psychological addiction.

Sunburn,A sunburn is reddening of the skin that occurs after you are overexposed to the sun or other ultraviolet light.,"Sunburn results when the amount of exposure to the sun or other ultraviolet light source exceeds the ability of melanin to protect the skin. Melanin is the skin's protective coloring (pigment). Sunburn in a very light-skinned person may occur in less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure, while a dark-skinned person may tolerate the same exposure for hours. Keep in mind: There is no such thing as a ""healthy tan."" Unprotected sun exposure causes early aging of the skin and skin cancer. Sun exposure can cause first- and second-degree burns . Skin cancer usually appears in adulthood. But it is caused by sun exposure and sunburns that began as early as childhood. Factors that make sunburn more likely: Infants and children are very sensitive to the burning effects of the sun. People with fair skin are more likely to get sunburn. But even dark and black skin can burn and should be protected. The sun's rays are strongest during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The sun's rays are also stronger at higher altitudes and lower latitudes (closer to the equator). Reflections off water, sand, or snow can make the sun's burning rays stronger. Sun lamps can cause severe sunburn. Some medicines (such as the antibiotics doxycycline and tetracycline) can make your skin easier to sunburn. Some medical conditions (such as lupus ) can make you more sensitive to the sun. Watch this video about: Sun's effect on skin",,"If you do get a sunburn: Take a cool shower or bath or place clean wet, cool wash cloths on the burn. DO NOT use products that contain benzocaine or lidocaine. These can cause allergies in some people and make the burn worse. If there are blisters, dry bandages may help prevent infection. If your skin is not blistering, moisturizing cream may be applied to relieve discomfort. DO NOT use butter, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), or other oil-based products. These can block pores so that heat and sweat cannot escape, which can lead to infection. DO NOT pick at or peel away the top part of the blisters. Creams with vitamins C and E may help limit damage to skin cells. Over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, help to relieve pain from sunburn. DO NOT give aspirin to children. Cortisone creams may help reduce inflammation. Loose cotton clothing should be worn. Drink lots of water. Ways to prevent sunburn include: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. A broad-spectrum sunscreen protects from both UVB and UVA rays. Apply a generous amount of sunscreen to fully cover exposed skin. Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours or as often as the label says. Reapply sunscreen after swimming or sweating and even when it is cloudy. Use a lip balm with sunscreen. Wear a hat with a wide brim and other protective clothing.

Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing. Swallowing is a complex act. Many nerves work in a fine balance to control how the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. A brain or nerve disorder can alter this fine balance in the muscles of the mouth and throat. Damage to the brain may be caused by multiple sclerosis , Parkinson disease , or stroke . Nerve damage may be due to spinal cord injuries, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig disease), or myasthenia gravis .

However, there may be some underlying cause. Problems that involve the esophagus often cause swallowing problems. These may include: An abnormal ring of tissue that forms where the esophagus and stomach meet (called Schatzki ring ). Abnormal spasms of the esophagus muscles . Cancer of the esophagus . Failure of the muscle bundle at the bottom of the esophagus to relax ( achalasia ). Scarring that narrows the esophagus called an esophageal stricture. This may be due to radiation, chemicals, medicines, chronic swelling, ulcers, infection, or esophageal reflux. Something stuck in the esophagus, such as a piece of food.

The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men (MSM). Young adults ages 20 to 35 are the highest-risk population. Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis). Syphilis has three stages: Primary syphilis Secondary syphilis Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness) Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States because of education, screening, and treatment.","The incubation period for primary syphilis is 14 to 21 days.

Tapeworm infection - beef or pork,Beef or pork tapeworm infection is an infection with the tapeworm parasite found in beef or pork.,"Tapeworm infection is caused by eating the raw or undercooked meat of infected animals. Cattle usually carry Taenia saginata ( T saginata ). Pigs carry Taenia solium (T solium) . In the human intestine, the young form of the tapeworm from the infected meat (larva) develops into the adult tapeworm. A tapeworm can grow to longer than 12 feet (3.5 meters) and can live for years. Tapeworms have many segments. Each segment is able to produce eggs. The eggs are spread alone or in groups and can pass out with the stool or through the anus. Adults and children with pork tapeworm can infect themselves if they have poor hygiene. They can ingest tapeworm eggs they pick up on their hands while wiping or scratching their anus or the skin around it. Those who are infected can expose other people to T solium eggs, usually through food handling.","Tapeworm infection usually does not cause any symptoms. Some people may have abdominal discomfort.

Tay-Sachs - resources,The following organizations provide information on Tay-Sachs disease:,,,,
Tay-Sachs disease,Tay-Sachs disease is a life-threatening disease of the nervous system passed down through families.,"Tay-Sachs disease occurs when the body lacks hexosaminidase A. This is a protein that helps break down a group of chemicals found in nerve tissue called gangliosides. Without this protein, gangliosides, particularly ganglioside GM2, build up in cells, often nerve cells in the brain. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. When both parents carry the defective Tay-Sachs gene, a child has a 25% chance of developing the disease. The child must receive two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, in order to become sick. If only one parent passes the defective gene to the child, the child is called a carrier. They will not be sick, but may pass the disease to their own children. Anyone can be a carrier of the Tay-Sachs gene. But, the disease is most common among people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, where 1 in every 27 people carries the Tay-Sachs gene. Tay-Sachs is divided into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms, depending on the symptoms and when they first appear. Most people with Tay-Sachs have the infantile form. In this form, the nerve damage usually begins while the baby is still in the womb. Symptoms usually appear when the child is 3 to 6 months old. The disease tends to get worse very quickly, and the child usually dies by age 4 or 5. Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, which affects adults, is very rare.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Deafness Decreased eye contact, blindness Decreased muscle tone (loss of muscle strength), loss of motor skills, paralysis Slow growth and delayed mental and social skills Dementia (loss of brain function) Increased startle reaction Irritability Listlessness Seizures",,GM2 gangliosidosis - Tay-Sachs; Lysosomal storage disease - Tay-Sachs disease

Tennis elbow,Tennis elbow is soreness or pain on the outside (lateral) side of the upper arm near the elbow.,"The part of the muscle that attaches to a bone is called a tendon. Some of the muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the outside of your elbow. When you use these muscles over and over again, small tears may develop in the tendon. Over time, the tendon cannot heal, and this leads to irritation and pain where the tendon is attached to the bone. This injury is common in people who play a lot of tennis or other racket sports, hence the name ""tennis elbow."" Backhand is the most common stroke to cause symptoms. But any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist (like using a screwdriver) can lead to this condition. Painters, plumbers, construction workers, cooks, and butchers are all more likely to develop tennis elbow. This condition may also be due to repetitive typing on the computer keyboard and mouse use.

Seminoma: This is a slow-growing form of testicular cancer found in men in their 40s and 50s. The cancer is in the testes, but it can spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node involvement is either treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiation therapy. Nonseminoma: This more common type of testicular cancer tends to grow more quickly than seminomas. Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to these different cell types: Choriocarcinoma (rare) Embryonal carcinoma Teratoma Yolk sac tumor A stromal tumor is a rare type of testicular tumor. They are usually not cancerous. The two main types of stromal tumors are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Stromal tumors usually occur during childhood.","There may be no symptoms.

Tetanus,"Tetanus is an infection of the nervous system with a type of bacteria that is potentially deadly, called Clostridium tetani (C tetani).","Spores of the bacterium C tetani are found in the soil, and in animal feces and mouth (gastrointestinal tract). In the spore form, C tetani can remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years. You can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores become active bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanus toxin (also known as tetanospasmin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause fractures of the spine. The time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.","Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw). The spasms can also affect your chest, neck, back, and abdominal muscles . Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos . Sometimes, the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems. Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups. This is called tetany. These are the episodes that can cause fractures and muscle tears.

Tetralogy of Fallot,Tetralogy of Fallot is a type of congenital heart defect. Congenital means that it is present at birth.,"Tetralogy of Fallot causes low oxygen levels in the blood. This leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin). The classic form includes four defects of the heart and its major blood vessels: Ventricular septal defect (hole between the right and left ventricles) Narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract (the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs) Overriding aorta (the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body) that is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle Thickened wall of the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy) Tetralogy of Fallot is rare, but it is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. It occurs equally as often in males and females. People with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to also have other congenital defects. The cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown. Many factors seem to be involved. Factors that increase the risk for this condition during pregnancy include: Alcoholism in the mother Diabetes Mother who is over 40 years old Poor nutrition during pregnancy Rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy Children with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to have chromosome disorders, such as Down syndrome, Alagille syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome (a condition that causes heart defects, low calcium levels, and poor immune function).","Symptoms include: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood, which gets worse when the baby is upset Clubbing of fingers (skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails) Difficulty feeding (poor feeding habits) Failure to gain weight Passing out Poor development Squatting during episodes of cyanosis (which increases blood flow to the lungs)",,Tet; TOF; Congenital heart defect - tetralogy; Cyanotic heart disease - tetralogy; Birth defect - tetralogy
Thalassemia,"Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form or inadequate amount of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in large numbers of red blood cells being destroyed, which leads to anemia.","Hemoglobin is made of two proteins: Alpha globin Beta globin Thalassemia occurs when there is a variant in a gene that helps control production of one of these proteins. There are two main types of thalassemia: Alpha thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin protein are missing or there is a variant. Beta thalassemia occurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin protein. Alpha thalassemias occur most often in people from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, China, and in those of African descent. Beta thalassemias occur most often in people of Mediterranean origin. To a lesser extent, Chinese, other Asians, and African Americans can be affected. There are many forms of thalassemia. Each type has many different subtypes. Both alpha and beta thalassemia include the following two forms: Thalassemia major Thalassemia minor You must inherit the variant gene from both parents to develop thalassemia major. Thalassemia minor occurs if you receive the variant gene from only one parent. People with this form of the disorder are carriers of the disease. Most of the time, they do not have symptoms. Beta thalassemia major is also called Cooley anemia. Risk factors for thalassemia include: Asian, Chinese, Mediterranean, or African American ethnicity Family history of the disorder","The most severe form of alpha thalassemia major causes stillbirth (death of the unborn baby during birth or the late stages of pregnancy). Children born with beta thalassemia major (Cooley anemia) are normal at birth, but develop severe anemia during the first year of life. Other symptoms can include: Bone deformities in the face Fatigue Growth failure Shortness of breath Yellow skin (jaundice) People with the minor form of alpha and beta thalassemia have small red blood cells but no symptoms.",,Mediterranean anemia; Cooley anemia; Beta thalassemia; Alpha thalassemia

Thromboangiitis obliterans,Thromboangiitis obliterans is a rare disease in which blood vessels of the hands and feet become blocked.,"Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) is caused by small blood vessels that become inflamed and swollen. The blood vessels then narrow or get blocked by blood clots (thrombosis). Blood vessels of the hands and feet are mostly affected. Arteries are more affected than veins. Average age when symptoms begin is around 35. Women and older adults are affected less often. This condition mostly affects young men ages 20 to 45 who are heavy smokers or chew tobacco. Female smokers may also be affected. The condition affects more people in the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, and Eastern Europe. Many people with this problem have poor dental health, most likely due to tobacco use.","Symptoms most often affect 2 or more limbs and may include: Fingers or toes that appear pale, red, or bluish and feel cold to the touch.

The pain is often located in the arch of the foot. Skin changes or small painful ulcers on the fingers or toes. Occasionally, arthritis in the wrists or knees develops before the blood vessels become blocked.",,Buerger disease
Thrombocytopenia,Thrombocytopenia means there is an abnormally low amount of platelets. Platelets are parts of the blood that help blood to clot. This condition is sometimes associated with abnormal bleeding.,"Thrombocytopenia is often divided into 3 major causes of low platelets: Not enough platelets are made in the bone marrow Increased removal of platelets in the bloodstream Increased trapping of platelets in the spleen or liver Your bone marrow may not make enough platelets if you have any of the following conditions: Aplastic anemia (disorder in which the bone marrow does not make enough blood cells) Cancer in the bone marrow, such as leukemia Cirrhosis (liver scarring) Folate deficiency Infections in the bone marrow (very rare) Myelodysplastic syndrome (bone marrow does not make enough blood cells or makes defective cells) Vitamin B12 deficiency Use of certain medicines may also lead to a low production of platelets in the bone marrow. The most common example is chemotherapy treatment for cancer. The following health situations cause a low number of platelets: Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active, most often during a serious illness ( disseminated intravascular coagulation - DIC ) Drug-induced low platelet count Enlarged spleen Disorder in which the immune system destroys platelets ( immune thrombocytopenic purpura - ITP ) Disorder that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels, causing a low platelet count ( thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - TTP )","You may not have any symptoms.

Thrombophlebitis,Thrombophlebitis is swelling (inflammation) of a vein. A blood clot (thrombus) in the vein is the most common cause of this swelling.,"Thrombophlebitis may affect deeper, larger veins or veins near the skin surface . Most of the time, it occurs in the pelvis and legs. Blood clots may form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins. Risk factors include: A pacemaker catheter that has been passed through the vein in the groin Bed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane travel Family history of blood clots, which may imply the presence of inherited disorders that lead to increased risk of clots. Common ones include deficiency or lack of antithrombin 3, protein C, and protein S, factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin abnormalities Fractures in the pelvis or legs Giving birth within the last 6 months Pregnancy Obesity Recent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery) Too many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (polycythemia vera) Having an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vessel Blood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as: Cancer Certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus Cigarette smoking Conditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots Taking estrogens or birth control pills (this risk is even higher with smoking)",Thrombophlebitis often causes the following symptoms: Swelling in the part of the body affected Pain in the part of the body affected Skin redness (not always present) Warmth and tenderness over the vein,,Phlebitis; Deep vein thrombosis - thrombophlebitis; Thrombophilia - thrombophlebitis
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a blood disorder in which platelet clumps form in small blood vessels. This leads to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).,"This disease may be caused by problems with an enzyme (a type of protein) that is involved in blood clotting. This enzyme is called ADAMTS13. Absence of this enzyme results in platelet clumping. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting. As the platelets clump together, fewer platelets are available in the blood in other parts of the body to help with clotting. This can lead to bleeding under the skin. In some cases, the disorder is passed down through families (inherited). In these cases, people are born with naturally low levels of this enzyme. This condition also may be caused by: Cancer Chemotherapy Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HIV infection Hormone replacement therapy and estrogens Medicines (including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, quinine, and cyclosporine A)","Symptoms may include any of the following: Bleeding into the skin or mucus membranes Confusion Fatigue , weakness Fever Headache Pale skin color or yellowish skin color Shortness of breath Fast heart rate (over 100 beats per minute)",,TTP
Thrush - children and adults,Thrush is a yeast infection of the tongue and lining of the mouth.,"Certain germs normally live in our bodies. These include bacteria and fungi. While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection under certain conditions. Thrush occurs in children and adults when conditions permit too much growth of a fungus called candida in your mouth. A small amount of this fungus normally lives in your mouth. It is most often kept in check by your immune system and other germs that also live in your mouth. When your immune system is weak or when normal bacteria die, too much of the fungus can overgrow and cause thrush. You are more likely to get thrush if you have one of the following: You are in poor health. You are very old. Young babies are also more likely to develop thrush. You have HIV or AIDS . You are receiving chemotherapy or drugs that weaken the immune system. You are taking steroid medicine, including some inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . You have diabetes mellitus and your blood sugar is high. You take antibiotics. Antibiotics kill some of the healthy bacteria that prevent candida from growing too much. Your dentures do not fit well. Candida can also cause yeast infections in the vagina. Thrush in newborns is somewhat common and easy to treat.","Symptoms of thrush include: White, velvety sores in the mouth and on the tongue Some bleeding when you brush your teeth or scrape the sores Pain when swallowing",,Candidiasis - oral; Oral thrush; Fungal infection - mouth; Candida - oral
Thrush in newborns,Thrush is a yeast infection of the tongue and mouth. This common infection can be passed between a mother and baby during breastfeeding.,"Certain germs normally live in our bodies. While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection. Thrush occurs when too much of a yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida albicans grows in a baby's mouth. Germs called bacteria and fungi naturally grow in our bodies. Our immune system helps keep these germs in check. But babies do not have fully-formed immune systems. That makes it easier for too much yeast to grow. Thrush often occurs when mother or baby has taken antibiotics. Antibiotics treat infections from bacteria. They can also kill good bacteria, and this allows yeast to grow. The yeast thrives in warm, moist areas. The baby's mouth and the mother's nipples are perfect places for a yeast infection. Babies can also get a yeast infection on the diaper area at the same time. The yeast gets in the baby's stool and can cause a diaper rash .","Symptoms of thrush in the baby include: White, velvety sores in the mouth and on the tongue Sores that may bleed when wiped Redness in the mouth Diaper rash Mood changes, such as being very fussy Refusing to nurse because of soreness Some babies may not feel anything at all.

Thyroid cancer,Thyroid cancer is a cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the front of your lower neck.,"Thyroid cancer can occur in people of any age. Radiation to the thyroid increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from: Radiation therapy to the neck (especially in childhood) Radiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters Other risk factors are a family history of thyroid cancer and chronic goiter (enlarged thyroid). Being overweight or having obesity may be a risk factor for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. There are several types of thyroid cancer: Anaplastic carcinoma (also called giant and spindle cell cancer) is the most dangerous form of thyroid cancer. It is rare, and spreads quickly. Follicular carcinoma is more likely to come back and spread. Medullary carcinoma is a cancer of non-thyroid hormone-producing cells that are normally present in the thyroid gland. This form of thyroid cancer tends to occur in families. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type, and it usually affects women of childbearing age. It spreads slowly and is the least dangerous type of thyroid cancer.","Symptoms vary depending on the type of thyroid cancer, but may include: Cough Difficulty swallowing Enlargement of the thyroid gland Hoarseness or changing voice Neck swelling Thyroid lump (nodule)",,Tumor - thyroid; Cancer - thyroid; Nodule - thyroid cancer; Papillary thyroid carcinoma; Medullary thyroid carcinoma; Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; Follicular thyroid cancer

It can occur in children and adults. Unlike other types of thyroid cancer, MTC is less likely to be caused by radiation therapy to the neck given to treat other cancers during childhood. There are two forms of MTC: Sporadic MTC, which does not run in families. Most MTCs are sporadic. This form mainly affects older adults. Hereditary MTC, which runs in families. You have an increased risk for this type of cancer if you have: A family history of MTC A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) A prior history of pheochromocytoma , mucosal neuromas, hyperparathyroidism or pancreatic endocrine tumors Other types of thyroid cancer include: Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid Thyroid lymphoma","MTC often begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland.

It may occur in childhood, but is most often seen in adults between ages 20 and 60. The cause of this cancer is not known. A genetic defect or family history of the disease may be a risk factor. Radiation increases the risk for developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from: High-dose external radiation treatments to the neck, especially during childhood, used to treat childhood cancer or some noncancerous childhood conditions Radiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters Radiation given through a vein (through an IV) during medical tests and treatments does not increase the risk for developing thyroid cancer.","Thyroid cancer often begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland.

Tick paralysis,Tick paralysis is a loss of muscle function that results from a tick bite.,Hard-bodied and soft-bodied female ticks are believed to make a poison that can cause paralysis in children. Ticks attach to the skin to feed on blood. The poison enters the bloodstream during this feeding process. The paralysis is ascending. That means it starts in the lower body and moves up.,"Children with tick paralysis develop an unsteady gait followed several days later by weakness in the lower legs. This weakness gradually moves up to involve the upper limbs. Paralysis may cause breathing difficulties , which may require the use of a breathing machine. The child may also have mild, flu-like symptoms (muscle aches, tiredness).",,

These structures include: Cartilage disk in the joint Muscles of the jaw, face, and neck Nearby ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves Teeth For many people with temporomandibular joint disorders, the cause is unknown. Some causes given for this condition are not well-proven. They include: A bad bite or orthodontic braces. Stress and tooth grinding. Many people with TMJ problems do not grind their teeth, and many who have been grinding their teeth for a long time do not have problems with their temporomandibular joint. For some people, the stress associated with this disorder may be caused by the pain, as opposed to being the cause of the problem. Poor posture can also be an important factor in TMJ symptoms. For example, holding your head forward while looking at a computer all day strains the muscles of your face and neck. Other factors that may make TMJ symptoms worse include poor diet and lack of sleep. Many people end up having ""trigger points."" These are contracted muscles in your jaw, head, and neck. Trigger points can refer pain to other areas, causing a headache, earache, or toothache.

Instead, they attach to another blood vessel or the wrong part of the heart. It is present at birth (congenital heart disease).","The cause of total anomalous pulmonary venous return is unknown. In normal circulation, blood is sent from the right ventricle to pick up oxygen in the lungs. It then returns through the pulmonary (lung) veins to the left side of the heart, which sends blood out through the aorta and around the body. In TAPVR, oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the right atrium or to a vein flowing into the right atrium, instead of the left side of heart. In other words, blood simply circles to and from the lungs and never gets out to the body. For the infant to live, an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (passage between the left and right atria) must exist to allow oxygenated blood to flow to the left side of the heart and the rest of the body. How severe this condition is depends on whether the pulmonary veins are blocked or obstructed as they drain. Obstructed TAPVR causes symptoms early in life and can be deadly very quickly if it is not found and corrected with surgery.","The infant may appear very sick and may have the following symptoms: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Frequent respiratory infections Lethargy Poor feeding Poor growth Rapid breathing Note: Sometimes, no symptoms may be present in infancy or early childhood.",,TAPVR; Total veins; Congenital heart defect - TAPVR; Cyanotic heart disease - TAPVR

Tourette syndrome,"Tourette syndrome is a condition that causes a person to make repeated, quick movements or sounds that they cannot control.","Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. The disorder is likely passed down through families. The syndrome may be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain. It may have to do with chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells signal one another. Tourette syndrome can be either severe or mild. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Far fewer people have more severe forms of Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is 3 times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. There is a 50% chance that a person with Tourette syndrome will pass the gene onto his or her children, although the children may have no or fewer symptoms.","Symptoms of Tourette syndrome are often first noticed during childhood, at about 6 years of age. Most children with Tourette syndrome also have other medical problems. These can include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) , impulse control disorder, or depression. The most common first symptom is a tic of the face. Other tics may follow. A tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound. Symptoms of Tourette syndrome can range from tiny, minor movements (such as grunts, sniffling, or coughing) to constant movements and sounds that cannot be controlled. Different types of tics can include: Arm thrusting Eye blinking Jumping Kicking Repeated throat clearing or sniffing Shoulder shrugging Tics may occur many times a day. They tend to improve or get worse at different times. The tics may change with time. Symptoms often get worse before the mid-teen years. Contrary to popular belief, only a small number of people use curse words or other inappropriate words or phrases (coprolalia). Tourette syndrome is different from OCD. People with OCD feel as though they have to do the behaviors. Sometimes a person can have both Tourette syndrome and OCD. Many people with Tourette syndrome can stop doing the tic for periods of time. But they find that the tic is stronger for a few minutes after they allow it to start again. Often, the tic slows or stops during sleep.",,Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; Tic disorders - Tourette syndrome; Tourette's syndrome

It develops after birth.",Acquired tracheomalacia is very uncommon at any age. It occurs when normal cartilage in the wall of the windpipe begins to break down. This form of tracheomalacia may result: When large blood vessels put pressure on the airway As a complication after surgery to repair birth defects in the windpipe and esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) After having a breathing tube or trachea tube (tracheostomy) for a long time,"Symptoms of tracheomalacia include: Breathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, or upper respiratory infections, such as a cold Breathing noises that may change when body position changes, and improve during sleep High-pitched breathing Rattling, noisy breaths",,Secondary tracheomalacia
Tracheomalacia - congenital,Congenital tracheomalacia is weakness and floppiness of the walls of the windpipe (trachea). Congenital means it is present at birth. Acquired tracheomalacia is a related topic.,"Tracheomalacia in a newborn occurs when the cartilage in the windpipe has not developed properly. Instead of being rigid, the walls of the trachea are floppy. Because the windpipe is the main airway, breathing problems begin soon after birth. Congenital tracheomalacia is very uncommon.","Symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Trachoma,Trachoma is an infection of the eye caused by bacteria called chlamydia.,"Trachoma is caused by infection with the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis . The condition occurs around the world. It is most often seen in rural areas of developing countries. Children are often affected. However, the scarring caused by the infection may not be noticed until later in life. The condition is rare in the United States. However, it is more likely to occur in crowded or unclean living conditions. The bacteria that cause trachoma are spread through direct contact with infected eye, nose, or throat fluids. They can also be passed by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels or clothes. Certain flies can also spread the bacteria.","Symptoms begin 5 to 12 days after being exposed to the bacteria. The condition begins slowly. It first appears as inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids ( conjunctivitis , or ""pink eye""). Untreated, this may lead to scarring. Symptoms may include: Cloudy cornea Discharge from the eye Swelling of lymph nodes just in front of the ears Swollen eyelids Turned-in eyelashes",,Granular conjunctivitis; Egyptian ophthalmia; Conjunctivitis - granular; Conjunctivitis - chlamydia

Transient ischemic attack,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for up to 24 hours. In most cases, the symptoms last for 1 to 2 hours.","A TIA is different than a stroke. After a TIA, the blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves on its own. A TIA does not cause brain tissue to die. The loss of blood flow to an area of the brain can be caused by: A blood clot in an artery of the brain A blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, from the heart) An injury to blood vessels Narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain High blood pressure is the main risk factor for TIAs and stroke. Other major risk factors are: Irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation Diabetes Family history of stroke Being male High cholesterol Tendency to have abnormal blood clotting Increasing age, especially after age 55 Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of stroke) Smoking Alcohol use Recreational drug use History of prior TIA or stroke People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries are also more likely to have a TIA or stroke.","Symptoms begin suddenly, last a short time (from a few minutes to 1 to 2 hours), and go away.

The symptoms of a TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke, and include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness or unconsciousness) Changes in the senses (such as hearing, vision, taste, and touch) Mental changes (such as confusion, memory loss, difficulty writing or reading, trouble speaking or understanding others) Muscle problems (such as weakness, trouble swallowing, trouble walking) Dizziness or loss of balance and coordination Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Sensation problems (such as numbness or tingling on one side of the body)",,Mini stroke; TIA; Little stroke; Cerebrovascular disease - TIA; Carotid artery - TIA
Transient tachypnea - newborn,"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a breathing disorder seen shortly after delivery, most often in early term or late preterm babies.","As the baby grows in the womb (uterus), the lungs make a special fluid. This fluid fills the baby's lungs and helps them grow. When the baby is born at term, hormones released during labor tell the lungs to stop making this special fluid. The baby's lungs start removing or reabsorbing it. The first few breaths a baby takes after delivery fill the lungs with air and help to clear most of the remaining lung fluid. Leftover fluid in the lungs causes the baby to breathe rapidly. It is harder for the small air sacs of the lungs to stay open. TTN is more likely to occur in babies who are: Born before 38 completed weeks gestation (preterm, or early term) Delivered by C-section , especially if labor has not already started Born to a mother with diabetes or asthma Twins","Newborns with TTN have breathing problems soon after birth, usually starting within 1 to 2 hours.

Transplant rejection,Transplant rejection is a process in which a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue.,"Your body's immune system usually protects you from substances that may be harmful, such as germs, poisons, and sometimes, cancer cells. These harmful substances have proteins called antigens coating their surfaces. As soon as these antigens enter the body, the immune system recognizes that they are not from that person's body and that they are ""foreign,"" and attacks them. When a person receives an organ from someone else during transplant surgery, that person's immune system may recognize that it is foreign. This is because the person's immune system detects that the antigens on the cells of the organ are different or not ""matched."" Mismatched organs, or organs that are not matched closely enough, can trigger a blood transfusion reaction or transplant rejection. To help prevent this reaction, doctors type, or match both the organ donor and the person who is receiving the organ. The more similar the antigens are between the donor and recipient, the less likely that the organ will be rejected. Tissue typing ensures that the organ or tissue is as similar as possible to the tissues of the recipient. The match is usually not perfect. No two people, except identical twins, have identical tissue antigens. Doctors use medicines to suppress the recipient's immune system. The goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking the newly transplanted organ. If these medicines are not used, the body will almost always launch an immune response and destroy the foreign tissue. There are some exceptions, though. Cornea transplants are rarely rejected because the cornea has no blood supply. Also, transplants from one identical twin to another are almost never rejected. There are three types of rejection: Hyperacute rejection occurs a few minutes after the transplant when the antigens are completely unmatched. The tissue must be removed right away so the recipient does not die. This type of rejection is seen when a recipient is given the wrong type of blood. For example, when a person is given type A blood when he or she is type B. Acute rejection may occur any time from the first week after the transplant to 3 months afterward. All recipients have some amount of acute rejection. Chronic rejection can take place over many years. The body's constant immune response against the new organ slowly damages the transplanted tissues or organ.","Symptoms may include: The organ's function may start to decrease General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling Pain or swelling in the area of the organ (rare) Fever (rare) Flu-like symptoms, including chills, body aches, nausea, cough, and shortness of breath The symptoms depend on the transplanted organ or tissue. For example, patients who reject a kidney may make less urine, and patients who reject a heart may have symptoms of heart failure.",,Graft rejection; Tissue/organ rejection

Transposition of the great arteries,Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a heart defect that occurs from birth (congenital). The two major arteries that carry blood away from the heart -- the aorta and the pulmonary artery -- are switched (transposed).,"The cause of TGA is unknown. It is not associated with any one common genetic abnormality. It rarely occurs in other family members. TGA is a cyanotic heart defect . This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. In normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen. The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body. In TGA, venous blood returns normally to the heart through the right atrium. But, instead of going to the lungs to absorb oxygen, this blood is pumped out through the aorta and back to the body. This blood has not been recharged with oxygen and leads to cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. Symptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward. How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of additional heart defects (such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much the blood can mix between the two abnormal circulations.",Symptoms may include: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Clubbing of the fingers or toes Poor feeding Shortness of breath,,d-TGA; Congenital heart defect - transposition; Cyanotic heart disease - transposition; Birth defect - transposition; Transposition of the great vessels; TGV

Domestic meat animals raised specifically for eating under US Department of Agriculture (government) guidelines and inspection can be considered safe. For this reason, trichinosis is rare in the United States, but it is a common infection worldwide. When a person eats meat from an infected animal, trichinella cysts break open in the intestine and grow into adult roundworms. The roundworms produce other worms that move through the gut wall and into the bloodstream. The worms invade muscle tissues, including the heart and diaphragm (the breathing muscle under the lungs).

Tricuspid atresia,"Tricuspid atresia is a type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital heart disease), in which the tricuspid heart valve is missing or abnormally developed. The defect blocks blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Other heart or vessel defects are usually present at the same time.","Tricuspid atresia is an uncommon form of congenital heart disease. It affects about 5 in every 100,000 live births. One in five people with this condition will also have other heart problems. Normally, blood flows from the body into the right atrium, then through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and on to the lungs. If the tricuspid valve does not open, the blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Because of the problem with the tricuspid valve, blood ultimately cannot enter the lungs. This is where it must go to pick up oxygen (becomes oxygenated). Instead, the blood passes through a hole between the right and left atrium. In the left atrium, it mixes with oxygen-rich blood returning from the lungs. This mix of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood is then pumped out into the body from the left ventricle. This causes the oxygen level in the blood to be lower than normal. In people with tricuspid atresia, the lungs receive blood either through a hole between the right and left atria (described above), or through maintenance of a fetal vessel called the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus connects the pulmonary artery (artery to the lungs) to the aorta (main artery to the body). It is present when a baby is born, but normally closes by itself shortly after birth.",Symptoms include: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Fast breathing Fatigue Poor growth Shortness of breath,,Tri atresia; Valve disorder - tricuspid atresia; Congenital heart - tricuspid atresia; Cyanotic heart disease - tricuspid atresia
Tricuspid regurgitation,"Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must pass through a heart valve. These valves open up enough so that blood can flow through. They then close, keeping blood from flowing backward.","An increase in size of the right ventricle is the most common cause of this condition. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs where it picks up oxygen. Any condition that puts extra strain on this chamber can cause it to enlarge. Examples include: Abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) which can come from a lung problem (such as COPD, or a clot that has traveled to the lungs) Other heart problem such as poor squeezing of the left side of the heart Problem with the opening or closing of another one of the heart valves Tricuspid regurgitation may also be caused or worsened by infections, such as: Rheumatic fever Infection of the tricuspid heart valve, which causes damage to the valve Less common causes of tricuspid regurgitation include: A type of heart defect present at birth called Ebstein anomaly.

Truncus arteriosus,"Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease in which a single blood vessel (truncus arteriosus) comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal 2 vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). It is present at birth (congenital heart disease).","In normal circulation, the pulmonary artery comes out of the right ventricle and the aorta comes out of the left ventricle, which are separate from each other. With truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles. There is most often also a large hole between the 2 ventricles ( ventricular septal defect ). As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix. Some of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, and some goes to the rest of the body. Often, more blood than usual ends up going to the lungs. If this condition is not treated, two problems occur: Too much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them. This makes it hard to breathe. If left untreated and more than normal blood flows to the lungs for a long time, the blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged. Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood through them. This is called pulmonary hypertension , which can be life threatening.",Symptoms include: Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood Delayed growth or growth failure Fatigue Lethargy Poor feeding Rapid breathing (tachypnea) Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Widening of the finger tips (clubbing),,Truncus

Tuberous sclerosis,"Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that affects the skin, brain/nervous system, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The condition can also cause tumors to grow in the brain. These tumors have a tuber or root-shaped appearance.","Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition. Changes (non-working gene variants or mutations) in one of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2 , are responsible for most cases. Only one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene for the child to get the disease. However, two-thirds of cases are due to new gene changes. In most cases, there is no family history of tuberous sclerosis. This condition is one of a group of diseases called neurocutaneous syndromes. Both the skin and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) are involved. There are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis. In that case, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.","Skin symptoms include: Areas of the skin that are white (due to decreased pigment) and have either an ash leaf or confetti appearance Red patches on the face containing many blood vessels (facial angiofibromas) Raised patches of skin with an orange-peel texture (shagreen spots), often on the back Brain symptoms include: Autism spectrum disorders Developmental delays Intellectual disability Seizures Other symptoms include: Pitted tooth enamel. Rough growths under or around the fingernails and toenails. Rubbery noncancerous tumors on or around the tongue. Lung disease known as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis). This is more common in women.

Tumor,A tumor is an abnormal growth of body tissue. Tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).,"In general, tumors occur when cells divide and grow excessively in the body. Normally, the body controls cell growth and division. New cells are created to replace older ones or to perform new functions. Cells that are damaged or no longer needed die to make room for healthy replacements. If the balance of cell growth and death is disturbed, a tumor may form. Problems with the body's immune system can lead to tumors. Tobacco causes more deaths from cancer than any other environmental substance. Other risk factors for cancer include: Benzene and other chemicals and toxins Drinking too much alcohol Environmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of poison that can grow on peanut plants (aflatoxins) Excessive sunlight exposure Genetic problems Obesity Radiation exposure Viruses Types of tumors known to be caused by or linked with viruses are: Burkitt lymphoma (Epstein-Barr virus) Cervical cancer (human papillomavirus, also called HPV) Most anal cancers (HPV) Some throat cancers, including soft palate, base of tongue and tonsils (HPV) Some vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers (HPV) Some liver cancers (hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses) Kaposi sarcoma (human herpesvirus 8) Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T-lymphotropic virus-1) Merkel cell carcinoma (Merkel cell polyomavirus) Nasopharyngeal cancer (Epstein-Barr virus) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma (HIV) Some tumors are more common in one sex than the other. Some are more common among children or older adults. Others are related to diet, environment, and family history.","Symptoms depend on the type and location of the tumor. For example, lung tumors may cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Tumors of the colon can cause weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, iron deficiency anemia, and blood in the stool.

Turner syndrome,Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which a female does not have the usual pair of X chromosomes.,"The typical number of human chromosomes is 46. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine if you become a boy or a girl. Females typically have 2 of the same sex chromosomes, written as XX. Males have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY). In Turner syndrome, cells are missing all or part of an X chromosome. The condition only occurs in females. Most commonly, a female with Turner syndrome has only 1 X chromosome. Others may have 2 X chromosomes, but one of them is incomplete. Sometimes, a female has some cells with 2 X chromosomes, but other cells have only 1. This situation is called mosaicism.","Possible findings of the head and neck include: Ears are low-set . Neck appears wide or web-like. Roof of the mouth is narrow (high palate). Hairline at the back of the head is lower. Lower jaw is lower and appears to fade away (recede). Drooping eyelids and dry eyes. Other findings may include: Fingers and toes are short. Hands and feet are swollen in infants. Nails are narrow and turn upward. Chest is broad and flat. Nipples appear more widely spaced. Height at birth is often smaller than average. A child with Turner syndrome is much shorter than children who are the same age and sex. This is called short stature . This problem may not be noticed in girls before age 11. Puberty may be absent or not complete. If puberty occurs, it most often begins at the normal age. After the age of puberty, unless treated with female hormones, these findings may be present: Pubic hair is often present and normal. Breast development may not occur. Menstrual periods are absent or very light. Vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse are common. Infertility. Sometimes, the diagnosis of Turner syndrome may not be made until adulthood. It may be discovered because a woman has very light or no menstrual periods and problems becoming pregnant.",,Bonnevie-Ullrich syndrome; Gonadal dysgenesis; Monosomy X; XO
Turpentine oil poisoning,"Turpentine oil comes from a substance in pine trees. Turpentine oil poisoning occurs when someone swallows turpentine oil or breathes in the fumes.

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome,Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare condition that occurs only in identical twins while they are in the womb.,"Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurs when the blood supply of one twin moves to the other through the shared placenta. The twin that loses the blood is called the donor twin. The twin that receives the blood is called the recipient twin. Both infants may have problems, depending on how much blood is passed from one to the other. The donor twin may have too little blood, and the other may have too much blood.","Most of the time, the donor twin is smaller than the other twin at birth. The infant often has anemia , is dehydrated, and looks pale. The recipient twin is born larger, with redness to the skin, too much blood, and a higher blood pressure. The twin that gets too much blood may develop cardiac failure because of the high blood volume. The infant may also need medicine to strengthen heart function. The unequal size of identical twins is referred to as discordant twins.",,TTTS; Fetal transfusion syndrome

Type 1 diabetes,Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood.,"Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. With type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This buildup of glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. It is an autoimmune disorder . This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. In people with type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. The tendency to develop autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, can be inherited from your parents.","HIGH BLOOD SUGAR The following symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes. Or, they may occur when blood sugar is high. Being very thirsty Feeling hungry Feeling tired all the time Having blurry eyesight Feeling numbness or tingling in your feet Losing weight despite an increased appetite Urinating more often (including urinating at night or bedwetting in children who were dry overnight before) For other people, these serious warning symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes. Or, they may happen when blood sugar is very high ( diabetic ketoacidosis ): Deep, rapid breathing Dry skin and mouth Flushed face Fruity breath odor Nausea and vomiting ; inability to keep down fluids Stomach pain LOW BLOOD SUGAR Low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) can develop quickly in people with diabetes who are taking insulin. Symptoms usually appear when a person's blood sugar level falls below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Watch for: Headache Hunger Nervousness, irritability Rapid heartbeat (palpitations) Shaking Sweating Weakness After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, and as a result, many other symptoms.",,Insulin-dependent diabetes; Juvenile onset diabetes; Diabetes - type 1; High blood sugar - type 1 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes,Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes.,"Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way. Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are not overweight or obese. This is more common in older adults. Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.","People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms at first. They may not have symptoms for many years. Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have eye, kidney, or nerve damage when they are first diagnosed. Early symptoms of diabetes caused by a high blood sugar level may include: Bladder, kidney, skin, or other infections that are more frequent or heal slowly Fatigue Hunger Increased thirst Increased urination Blurred vision After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, and as a result, many other complications.",,Diabetes - type II; Adult-onset diabetes; Diabetic - type 2 diabetes; Oral hypoglycemic - type 2 diabetes; High blood sugar - type 2 diabetes
Type V glycogen storage disease,"Type V (five) glycogen storage disease (GSD V) is a rare inherited condition in which the body is not able to break down glycogen. Glycogen is an important source of energy that is stored in all tissues, especially in the muscles and liver.","GSD V is caused by a flaw in the gene that makes an enzyme called muscle glycogen phosphorylase. As a result, the body cannot break down glycogen in the muscles. GSD V is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means to have the disorder, you must receive a copy of the nonworking gene from both parents. A person who receives a nonworking gene from only one parent usually does not develop this syndrome. A family history of GSD V increases the risk.","Symptoms commonly start during early childhood. But, it may be difficult to separate these symptoms from those of normal childhood.

Typhoid fever,"Typhoid fever is an infection that causes fever, diarrhea, and a rash. It is most commonly caused by bacteria called Salmonella typhi (S typhi).","S typhi is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body. Some people become carriers of S typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools, sometimes for years, spreading the disease. Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.","Early symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103°F, or 39.5°C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse. Some people develop a rash called ""rose spots,"" which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest. Other symptoms that occur include: Bloody stools Chills Agitation, confusion , delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there ( hallucinations ) Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit) Nosebleeds Severe fatigue Slow, sluggish, weak feeling",,Enteric fever
Typhus,Typhus is a bacterial disease spread by lice or fleas.,"Typhus is caused by two types of bacteria: Rickettsia typhi or Rickettsia prowazekii . Rickettsia typhi causes endemic or murine typhus. Endemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor, and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called ""jail fever."" The bacteria that cause this type of typhus is usually spread from rats to fleas to humans. Murine typhus occurs in the southern United States, including California and Texas. It is often seen during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. You are more likely to get this type of typhus if you are around rat feces or fleas, and other animals such as cats, possums, raccoons, and skunks. Rickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus. It is spread by lice. Brill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the bacteria become active again in a person who was previously infected. It is more common in older adults.","Symptoms of murine or endemic typhus may include: Abdominal pain Backache Dull red rash that begins on the middle of the body and spreads Fever, can be extremely high, 105°F to 106°F (40.6°C to 41.1°C) and can last up to 2 weeks Hacking, dry cough Headache Joint and muscle pain Nausea and vomiting Symptoms of epidemic typhus may include: High fever, chills Confusion, decreased alertness, delirium Cough Severe muscle and joint pain Lights that appear very bright; light may hurt the eyes Low blood pressure Rash that begins on the chest and spreads to the rest of the body (except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet) Severe headache The early rash is a light rose color and fades when you press on it.

Ulcerative colitis,Ulcerative colitis is a condition in which the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum become inflamed. It is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn disease is another form of IBD.,"The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. People with this condition have problems with their immune system. However, it is not clear if immune problems cause this illness. Stress and certain foods can trigger symptoms, but they do not cause ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis may affect any age group. The peaks in the age of onset occur at ages 15 to 30 and then again at ages 50 to 70. The disease begins in the rectal area. It may stay in the rectum or spread to higher areas of the large intestine. However, the disease does not skip areas. It may involve the entire large intestine over time. Risk factors include a family history of ulcerative colitis or other autoimmune diseases, or Jewish ancestry.","The symptoms can be more or less severe. They may start slowly or suddenly. Half of people only have mild symptoms. Others have more severe attacks that occur more often. Many factors can lead to attacks. Symptoms may include: Pain in the abdomen (belly area) and cramping.

Ulnar nerve dysfunction,"Ulnar nerve dysfunction is a problem with one of the nerves that travel from the shoulder to the hand, called the ulnar nerve. It helps you move your arm, wrist, and hand.","Damage to one nerve, such as the ulnar nerve, is called mononeuropathy . Mononeuropathy means there is damage to a single nerve. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage. Causes of mononeuropathy include: An illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve Direct injury to the nerve Long-term pressure on the nerve Pressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures Ulnar neuropathy is also common in those with diabetes . Ulnar neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the ulnar nerve. This nerve travels down the arm to the wrist, hand, and ring and little fingers. It passes just under the surface of the skin near the elbow. So, bumping the nerve there causes the pain and tingling of hitting your funny bone. When the nerve is compressed in the elbow, a problem called cubital tunnel syndrome may result. The ulnar nerve can also get compressed in the wrist and less often, at other parts of the arm. When damage destroys the nerve covering ( myelin sheath ) or part of the nerve itself, nerve signaling is slowed or prevented. When the nerve fibers themselves (axons) are injured, this may cause a more severe problem. Damage to the ulnar nerve can be caused by: Long-term pressure on the elbow or base of the palm An elbow fracture or dislocation Keeping the elbow bent for a long time or repeated elbow bending, such as with repetitive movements at work, or cigarette smoking In some cases, no cause can be found.","Symptoms may include any of the following: Abnormal sensations in the little finger and part of the ring finger, usually on the palm side Weakness , loss of coordination of the fingers Claw-like deformity of the hand and wrist Pain, numbness , decreased sensation, tingling, or burning sensation in the areas controlled by the nerve Pain or numbness may awaken you from sleep.

Umbilical cord care in newborns,"When your baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut and there is a stump left. The stump should dry and fall off by the time your baby is 5 to 15 days old. Keep the stump clean with gauze and water only. Sponge bathe the rest of your baby, as well. Do not put your baby in a tub of water until the stump has fallen off.",,,,
Umbilical hernia,An umbilical hernia is an outward bulge in the area around the belly button. It occurs when internal organs or the abdominal lining bulges through the muscles near the belly button.,"In the womb, the umbilical cord is attached to the baby through an opening in the baby's abdomen. After birth, this opening normally closes. When this area doesn't close completely, it leaves a weak spot in the abdomen, which can lead to a hernia. Hernias may be seen after birth or later in life. Umbilical hernias are common in infants. They occur slightly more often in African Americans. Most umbilical hernias are not related to disease. Some umbilical hernias are linked with rare conditions such as Down syndrome .","A hernia can vary in width from less than 1 centimeter (cm) to more than 5 cm (about 1/2 to 2 inches). There is a soft swelling over the belly button that often bulges when the baby sits up, cries, or strains. The bulge may be flat when the infant lies on the back and is quiet. Umbilical hernias are usually painless.",,

An umbilical hernia is a sac (pouch) formed from the inner lining of your belly (abdominal cavity) that pushes through a hole in the abdominal wall at the belly button.,,,,Umbilical hernia surgery; Umbilical herniorrhaphy
Unconsciousness - first aid,Unconsciousness is when a person is unable to respond to people and activities. Doctors often call this a coma or being in a comatose state.,"Unconsciousness can be caused by nearly any major illness or injury. It can also be caused by substance (drug) and alcohol use. Choking on an object can result in unconsciousness as well. Brief unconsciousness (or fainting ) is often a result from dehydration, low blood sugar , or temporary low blood pressure. It can also be caused by serious heart or nervous system problems. A doctor will determine if the affected person needs tests to diagnose their fainting. Other causes of fainting include straining during a bowel movement or urination, coughing very hard, breathing very fast (hyperventilating), or vasovagal syncope.","The person will be unresponsive (does not respond to activity, touch, sound, or other stimulation). The following symptoms may occur after a person has been unconscious: Amnesia for (not remembering) events before, during, and even after the period of unconsciousness Confusion Drowsiness Headache Inability to speak or move parts of the body ( stroke symptoms) Lightheadedness Loss of bowel or bladder control (incontinence) Rapid heartbeat ( palpitations ) Slow heartbeat Stupor (severe confusion and weakness) If the person is unconscious from choking, symptoms may include: Inability to speak Difficulty breathing Noisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling Weak, ineffective coughing Bluish skin color Being asleep is not the same as being unconscious. A sleeping person will respond to loud noises or gentle shaking. An unconscious person will not.",,Loss of consciousness - first aid; Coma - first aid; Mental status change; Altered mental status; Syncope - first aid; Faint - first aid
Undescended testicle,Undescended testicle occurs when one or both testicles fail to move into the scrotum before birth.,"Most of the time, a boy's testicles descend into the scrotum by the time he is 6 months old. Undescended testicles are common in infants who are born early. The problem occurs less in full-term infants. Some babies have a condition called retractile testes and the health care provider may not be able to find the testicles. In this case, the testicle is normal, but is pulled back out of the scrotum by a muscle reflex. This occurs because the testicles are still small before puberty. The testicles will descend normally at puberty and surgery is not needed. Testicles that do not naturally descend into the scrotum are considered abnormal. An undescended testicle is more likely to develop cancer, even if it is brought into the scrotum with surgery. Cancer is also more likely in the other testicle. Bringing the testicle into the scrotum can improve sperm production and increase the chances of good fertility. It also allows the provider to do an exam for the early detection of cancer. In other cases, no testicle may be found, even during surgery. This may be due to a problem that occurred while the baby was still developing before birth.",Most of the time there are no symptoms other than the absence of the testicle in the scrotum. (This is called an empty scrotum.),,Cryptorchidism; Empty scrotum - undescended testes; Scrotum - empty (undescended testes); Monorchism; Vanished testes - undescended; Retractile testes

Unstable angina,Unstable angina is a condition in which your heart doesn't get enough blood flow and oxygen. It may lead to a heart attack.,"Coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of unstable angina. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty material, called plaque, along the walls of the arteries. This causes arteries to become narrowed and less flexible. The narrowing can reduce blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain. People with unstable angina are at higher risk of having a heart attack. Less common causes of angina are: Abnormal function of tiny branch arteries without narrowing of larger arteries (called microvascular dysfunction or Syndrome X) Coronary artery spasm Risk factors for coronary artery disease include: Diabetes Family history of early coronary heart disease (a close relative such as a sibling or parent had heart disease before age 55 in a man or before age 65 in a woman) High blood pressure High LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol Male sex Sedentary lifestyle (not getting enough exercise) Obesity Older age Smoking","Symptoms of angina may include: Chest pain that you may also feel in the shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, back, or other area Discomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching Discomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine Shortness of breath Sweating With stable angina, the chest pain or other symptoms only occur with a certain amount of activity or stress. The pain does not occur more often or get worse over time. Unstable angina is chest pain that is sudden and often gets worse over a short period of time. You may be developing unstable angina if your chest pain: Starts to feel different, is more severe, comes more often, or occurs with less activity or while you are at rest Lasts longer than 15 to 20 minutes Occurs without cause (for example, while you are asleep or sitting quietly) Does not respond well to a medicine called nitroglycerin (especially if this medicine worked to relieve chest pain in the past) Occurs with a drop in blood pressure or shortness of breath Unstable angina is a warning sign that a heart attack may happen soon and needs to be treated right away.

Ureterocele,A ureterocele is a swelling at the bottom of one of the ureters. Ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder. The swollen area can block urine flow.,"A ureterocele occurs in the lower part of the ureter, where it enters the bladder. The swollen area prevents urine from moving freely into the bladder. The urine collects in the ureterocele and stretches its walls. It expands like a water balloon. A ureterocele can also cause urine to flow backward from the bladder to the kidney. This is called reflux which may damage the kidney. Ureteroceles occur in about 1 in 500 people. This condition is equally common in both the left and right ureters.","Most people with ureteroceles do not have any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include: Abdominal pain Back pain that may be only on one side Severe side (flank) pain and spasms that may reach to the groin, genitals, and thigh Blood in the urine Burning pain while urinating ( dysuria ) Fever Difficulty starting urine flow or slowing of urine flow Urinary tract infection Some other symptoms are: Foul-smelling urine Frequent and urgent urination Lump (mass) in the abdomen that can be felt Ureterocele tissue falls down (prolapse) through the female urethra and into the vagina Urinary incontinence",,Incontinence - ureterocele
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a blockage at the point where part of the kidney attaches to one of the tubes to the bladder (ureters). This blocks the flow of urine out of the kidney.,"UPJ obstruction mostly occurs in children. It often happens when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth). The blockage is caused when there is: A narrowing of area between the ureter and the part of the kidney called the renal pelvis An abnormal blood vessel crossing over the ureter As a result, urine builds up and damages the kidney. In older children and adults, the problem may be due to scar tissue, infection, earlier treatments for a blockage, or kidney stones. UPJ obstruction is the most common cause of urinary blockages in children. It is now commonly found before birth with ultrasound tests. In some cases, the condition may not show up until after birth. Surgery may be needed early in life if the problem is severe. Most of the time, surgery is not needed until later. Some cases do not require surgery at all.","There may not be any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include: Back or flank pain especially when consuming diuretics such as alcohol or caffeine Bloody urine (hematuria) Lump in the abdomen (abdominal mass) Kidney infection Poor growth in infants (failure to thrive) Urinary tract infection , usually with fever Vomiting",,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction; UP junction obstruction; Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction

Urethral stricture,Urethral stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder.,"A urethral stricture may be caused by swelling or scar tissue from surgery. It can also occur after an infection or injury. Rarely, it may be caused by pressure from a growing tumor near the urethra. Other factors that increase the risk for this condition include: Sexually transmitted infection (STI) Procedures that place a tube into the urethra (such as a catheter or cystoscope ) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Injury to the pelvic area Repeated urethritis Strictures that are present at birth (congenital) are rare. The condition is also rare in women.",Symptoms include: Blood in the semen Discharge from the urethra Bloody or dark urine Strong urge to urinate and frequent urination Inability to empty bladder (urinary retention) Painful urination or difficulty urinating Loss of bladder control Increased frequency or urgency to urinate Pain in the lower abdomen and pelvic area Slow urine stream (may develop suddenly or gradually) or spraying of urine Swelling of the penis,,
Urethritis,Urethritis is inflammation (swelling and irritation) of the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the body.,"Both bacteria and viruses may cause urethritis. Some of the bacteria that cause this condition include E coli, chlamydia , and gonorrhea . These bacteria also cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and some sexually transmitted diseases. Viral causes are herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. Other causes include: Injury Sensitivity to the chemicals used in spermicides, contraceptive jellies, or foams Sometimes the cause is unknown. Risks for urethritis include: Being a female Being male, ages 20 to 35 Having many sexual partners High-risk sexual behavior (such as men having penetrating anal sex without a condom) History of sexually transmitted diseases","In men: Blood in the urine or semen Burning pain while urinating ( dysuria ) Discharge from penis Fever (rare) Frequent or urgent urination Itching, tenderness, or swelling in penis Enlarged lymph nodes in the groin area Pain with intercourse or ejaculation In women: Abdominal pain Burning pain while urinating Fever and chills Frequent or urgent urination Pelvic pain Pain with intercourse Vaginal discharge",,Urethral syndrome; NGU; Non-gonococcal urethritis
Urge incontinence,"Urge incontinence occurs when you have a strong, sudden need to urinate that is difficult to delay. The bladder then squeezes, or spasms, and you may lose urine.","As your bladder fills with urine from the kidneys, it stretches to make room for the urine. You should feel the first urge to urinate when there is a bit less than 1 cup (240 milliliters) of urine in your bladder. Most people can hold more than 2 cups (480 milliliters) of urine in the bladder. Two muscles help prevent the flow of urine: The sphincter is a muscle around the opening of the bladder. It squeezes to prevent urine from leaking into the urethra. This is the tube that urine passes through from your bladder to the outside. The bladder wall muscle relaxes so the bladder can expand and hold urine. When you urinate, the bladder wall muscle squeezes to force urine out of the bladder. As this happens, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow the urine to pass through. All of these systems must work together to control urination: Your bladder muscles and other parts of your urinary tract The nerves controlling your urinary system Your ability to feel and respond to the urge to urinate The bladder may contract too often due to nervous system problems or bladder irritation. Watch this video about: Bladder function - neurological control URGE INCONTINENCE With urge incontinence, you leak urine because the bladder muscles squeeze, or contract, at the wrong times. These contractions often occur no matter how much urine is in the bladder. Urge incontinence may result from: Bladder cancer Bladder inflammation Something blocking urine from leaving the bladder Bladder stones Infection Brain or nerve problems, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke , that affects the bladder muscles Nerve injury, such as from a spinal cord injury In men, urge incontinence also may be due to: Bladder changes caused by an enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) An enlarged prostate blocking urine from flowing from the bladder In most cases of urge incontinence, no cause can be found. Although urge incontinence may occur in anyone at any age, it is more common in women and older adults.",Symptoms include: Not being able to control when you pass urine Having to urinate often during the day and night Needing to urinate suddenly and urgently,,Overactive bladder; Detrusor instability; Detrusor hyperreflexia; Irritable bladder; Spasmodic bladder; Unstable bladder; Incontinence - urge; Bladder spasms; Urinary incontinence - urge

Urinary incontinence,"Urinary (or bladder) incontinence occurs when you are not able to keep urine from leaking out of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine.","Causes of urinary incontinence include: Blockage in the urinary system Brain or nerve problems Dementia or other mental health problems that make it hard to feel and respond to the urge to urinate Problems with the urinary system Nerve and muscle problems Weakness of the pelvic or urethral muscles Enlarged prostate Diabetes Use of certain medicines Incontinence may be sudden and go away after a short period of time. Or, it may continue long-term. Causes of sudden or temporary incontinence include: Bedrest -- such as when you are recovering from surgery Certain medicines (such as diuretics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, some cough and cold remedies, and antihistamines) Mental confusion Pregnancy Prostate infection or inflammation Stool impaction from severe constipation, which causes pressure on the bladder Urinary tract infection or inflammation Weight gain Causes that may be more long-term include: Alzheimer disease . Bladder cancer. Bladder spasms. Large prostate in men. Nervous system conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke. Nerve or muscle damage after radiation treatment to the pelvis. Pelvic prolapse in women which is falling or sliding of the bladder, urethra, or rectum into the vagina. This may be caused by pregnancy and delivery. Problems with the urinary tract. Spinal cord injuries. Weakness of the sphincter, the circle-shaped muscles that open and close the bladder. This can be caused by prostate surgery in men, or surgery to the vagina in women.",,"If you have symptoms of incontinence, see your health care provider for evaluation, tests, and a treatment plan. Which treatment you get depends on what caused your incontinence and what type you have. There are several treatment approaches for urinary incontinence: Lifestyle changes. These changes may help improve incontinence. You may need to make these changes along with other treatments. Keep your bowel movements regular to avoid constipation. Try increasing the fiber in your diet. Quit smoking to reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, which can stimulate your bladder. Lose weight if you need to. Avoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus fruits and juices. If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control. For urine leaks, wear absorbent pads or undergarments. There are many well-designed products that no one else will notice. Bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Bladder retraining helps you gain better control over your bladder. Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Your provider can show you how to do them. Many women do not do these exercises correctly, even if they believe they are doing them correctly. Often, people benefit from formal bladder strengthening and retraining with a pelvic floor specialist. Medicines. Depending on the type of incontinence you have, your provider may prescribe one or more medicines. These medicines help prevent bladder muscle spasms, relax the bladder, and improve bladder function. Your provider can help you learn how to take these medicines and manage their side effects. Surgery. If other treatments do not work, or you have severe incontinence, your provider may recommend surgery. The type of surgery you have will depend on: The type of incontinence you have (such as urge , stress , or overflow) The severity of your symptoms The cause (such as pelvic prolapse, enlarged prostate , enlarged uterus, or other causes) If you have overflow incontinence or you cannot fully empty your bladder, you may need to use a catheter . You may use a catheter that stays in long-term, or one that you are taught to put in and take out yourself. Bladder nerve stimulation. Urge incontinence and urinary frequency can sometimes be treated by electrical nerve stimulation. Pulses of electricity are used to reprogram bladder reflexes. In one technique, the provider inserts a stimulator through the skin near a nerve in the leg. This is done weekly in the provider's office. Another method uses battery-operated implanted device similar to a pacemaker that is placed under the skin in the lower back. Botox injections. Urge incontinence can sometimes be treated with an injection of onabotulinum A toxin (also known as Botox). The injection relaxes the bladder muscle and increases the storage capacity of the bladder. The injection is delivered through a thin tube with a camera on the end (cystoscope). In most cases, the procedure can be done in the provider's office.",Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary; Overactive bladder

Urinary tract infection - adults,"A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of the urinary tract. The infection can occur at different points in the urinary tract, including the:","Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs. Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI. The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI: Diabetes Advanced age Conditions that affect personal care habits (such as Alzheimer disease and delirium ) Problems emptying the bladder completely Having a urinary catheter Bowel incontinence Enlarged prostate , narrowed urethra , or anything that blocks the flow of urine Kidney stones Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture) Pregnancy Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract","The symptoms of a bladder infection include: Cloudy or bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odor Low grade fever in some people Pain or burning with urination Pressure or cramping in the lower abdomen or back Strong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied If the infection spreads to your kidneys, symptoms may include: Chills and shaking or night sweats Fatigue and a general ill feeling Fever above 101°F (38.3°C) Pain in the side, back, or groin Flushed, warm, or reddened skin Mental changes or confusion (in older people, these symptoms often are the only signs of a UTI) Nausea and vomiting Severe abdominal pain (sometimes)",,Bladder infection - adults; UTI - adults; Cystitis - bacterial - adults; Pyelonephritis - adults; Kidney infection - adults
Urinary tract infection - children,A urinary tract infection is a bacterial infection of the urinary tract. This article discusses urinary tract infections in children.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can occur when bacteria get into the bladder or the kidneys. These bacteria are common on the skin around the anus. They can also be present near the vagina. Some factors make it easier for bacteria to enter or stay in the urinary tract, such as: Vesicoureteral reflux in which urine flow backs up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys. Brain or nervous system illnesses (such as myelomeningocele or spinal cord injury). Bubble baths or tight-fitting clothes (girls). Changes or birth defects in the structure of the urinary tract. Not urinating often enough during the day. Wiping from back (near the anus) to front after going to the bathroom. In girls, this can bring bacteria to the opening where the urine comes out. UTIs are more common in girls. This may occur as children begin toilet training around 3 years of age. Boys who are not circumcised have a slightly higher risk of UTIs before age 1.","Young children with UTIs may have a fever, poor appetite, vomiting, or no symptoms at all. Most UTIs in children only involve the bladder. It may spread to the kidneys. Symptoms of a bladder infection in children include: Blood in the urine Cloudy urine Foul or strong urine odor Frequent or urgent need to urinate General ill feeling ( malaise ) Pain or burning with urination Pressure or pain in the lower pelvis or lower back Wetting problems after the child has been toilet trained Signs that the infection may have spread to the kidneys include: Chills with shaking Fever Flushed, warm, or reddened skin Nausea and vomiting Pain in the side (flank) or back Severe pain in the belly area",,UTI - children; Cystitis - children; Bladder infection - children; Kidney infection - children; Pyelonephritis - children
Urinating more at night,"Normally, the amount of urine your body produces decreases at night. This allows most people to sleep 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate.","Drinking too much fluid during the evening can cause you to urinate more often during the night. Caffeine and alcohol with or after dinner can also lead to this problem. Other common causes of urination at night include: Infection of the bladder or urinary tract Drinking a lot of alcohol, caffeine, or other fluids before bedtime Enlarged prostate gland ( benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH ) Pregnancy Other conditions that can lead to the problem include: Chronic kidney failure Diabetes Drinking excessive amount of water Heart failure High blood calcium level Certain medicines, including water pills (diuretics) Diabetes insipidus Swelling of the legs Waking often during the night to urinate can also be linked to obstructive sleep apnea and other sleeping disorders. Nocturia may go away when the sleeping problem is under control. Stress and restlessness can also cause you to wake up at night.",,"To monitor the problem: Keep a diary of how much fluid you drink, how often you urinate, and how much you urinate. Record your body weight at the same times and on the same scale daily.",Nocturia
Urination - difficulty with flow,Difficulty starting or maintaining a urine stream is called urinary hesitancy.,"The most common cause of urinary hesitancy in older men is an enlarged prostate. Almost all older men have some trouble with dribbling, weak urine stream, and starting urination. Another common cause is infection of the prostate or urinary tract. Symptoms of a possible infection include: Burning or pain with urination Frequent urination Cloudy urine Sense of urgency (strong, sudden urge to urinate) Blood in the urine The problem can also be caused by: Some medicines (such as remedies for colds and allergies, tricyclic antidepressants, some medicines used for incontinence, and some vitamins and supplements) Nervous system disorders or problems with the spinal cord Side effects of surgery Scar tissue (stricture) in the tube leading from the bladder (urethra) Spastic muscles in the pelvis",,Steps you can take to care for yourself include: Keep track of your urination patterns and bring the report to your health care provider. Apply heat to your lower abdomen (below your belly button and above the pubic bone). This is where the bladder sits. The heat relaxes muscles and aids urination. Massage or apply light pressure over your bladder to help the bladder empty. Take a warm bath or shower to help stimulate urination.,Delayed urination; Hesitancy; Difficulty initiating urination
Urination - excessive amount,Excessive amount of urination means that your body makes larger than normal amounts of urine each day.,"An excessive volume of urination for an adult is more than 2.5 liters (about 67 fluid ounces or about 2.6 quarts) of urine per day. However, this can vary depending on how much water you drink and what your total body water is. This problem is different from needing to urinate often. Polyuria is a fairly common symptom. People often notice the problem when they have to get up during the night to use the toilet (nocturia). Some common causes of the problems are: Diabetes insipidus Diabetes mellitus Drinking excessive amounts of water Less common causes include: Kidney failure Medicines such as diuretics and lithium High or low calcium level in the body Drinking alcohol and caffeine Sickle cell anemia Also, your urine production may increase for 24 hours after having tests that involve injecting a special dye (contrast medium) into your vein during imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI scan .",,"To monitor your urine output, keep a daily record of the following: How much and what you drink How often you urinate and how much urine you produce each time How much you weigh (use the same scale every day)",Polyuria
Urination - painful,"Painful urination is any pain, discomfort, or burning sensation when passing urine.","Painful urination is most often caused by an infection or inflammation somewhere in the urinary tract, such as: Bladder infection (adult) Bladder infection (child) Swelling and irritation of the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra) Painful urination in women and girls may be due to: Changes in the vaginal tissue during menopause ( atrophic vaginitis ) Herpes infection in the genital area Irritation of the vaginal tissue caused by bubble bath, perfumes, or lotions Vulvovaginitis , such as yeast or other infections of the vulva and vagina Other causes of painful urination include: Interstitial cystitis Prostate infection ( prostatitis ) Radiation cystitis - damage to the bladder lining from radiation therapy to the pelvis area Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia Bladder spasms",,,Dysuria; Painful urination
Urine - abnormal color,"The usual color of urine is straw-yellow. Abnormally-colored urine may be cloudy, dark, or blood-colored.","Abnormal urine color may be caused by infection, disease, medicines, or food you eat. Cloudy or milky urine is a sign of a urinary tract infection, which may also cause a bad smell. Milky urine may also be caused by bacteria, crystals, fat, white or red blood cells, or mucus in the urine. Dark brown but clear urine is a sign of a liver disorder such as acute viral hepatitis or cirrhosis , which causes excess bilirubin in the urine. It can also indicate severe dehydration or a condition involving the breakdown of muscle tissue known as rhabdomyolysis . Pink, red, or lighter brown urine can be caused by: Beets, blackberries, or certain food colorings Hemolytic anemia Injury to the kidneys or urinary tract Medicines Porphyria Urinary tract disorders that cause bleeding Blood from vaginal bleeding Tumor in the bladder or kidneys Dark yellow or orange urine can be caused by: B complex vitamins or carotene Medicines such as phenazopyridine (used to treat urinary tract infections), rifampin, and warfarin Recent laxative use Green or blue urine is due to: Artificial colors in foods or medicines Bilirubin Medicines, including methylene blue Urinary tract infections",,,Discoloration of urine

The discharge may be:,"Glands in the cervix and the walls of the vagina normally produce clear mucus. This is very common among women of childbearing age. These secretions may turn white or yellow when exposed to the air. The amount of mucus produced varies during the menstrual cycle. This happens due to the change in hormone levels in the body. The following factors can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge: Ovulation (the release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of menstrual cycle) Pregnancy Sexual excitement Different types of infections may cause itching or an abnormal discharge in the vagina.

Varicocele,A varicocele is the swelling of the veins inside the scrotum. These veins are found along the cord that holds up a man's testicles (spermatic cord).,"A varicocele forms when valves inside the veins that run along the spermatic cord prevent blood from flowing properly. Blood backs up, leading to swelling and widening of the veins. (This is similar to varicose veins in the legs.) Most of the time, varicoceles develop slowly. They are more common in men ages 15 to 25 and are most often seen on the left side of the scrotum . A varicocele in an older man that appears suddenly may be caused by a kidney tumor , which can block blood flow to a vein.","Symptoms include: Enlarged, twisted veins in the scrotum Dull ache or discomfort Painless testicle lump , scrotal swelling , or bulge in the scrotum Possible problems with fertility or decreased sperm count Some men do not have symptoms.",,Varicose veins - scrotum

Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are swollen, twisted, and enlarged veins that you can see under the skin. They are often red or blue in color. They most often appear in the legs, but can occur in other parts of the body.","Normally, one-way valves in your leg veins keep blood moving up toward the heart. When the valves do not work properly, they allow blood to back up into the vein. The vein swells from the blood that collects there, which causes varicose veins over time. Varicose veins are common, and affect more women than men. They do not cause problems for most people. However, if the flow of blood through veins becomes poor enough, problems such as leg swelling and pain, blood clots, and skin changes may be present. Risk factors include: Older age Being female (hormonal changes from puberty, pregnancy, and menopause can lead to varicose veins, and taking birth control pills or hormone replacement can increase your risk) Being born with defective valves in the veins Obesity Pregnancy History of blood clots in your legs Standing or sitting for long periods of time Family history of varicose veins","Symptoms of varicose veins include: Fullness, heaviness, aching, and sometimes pain in the legs Visible, swollen veins Very small veins that you can see on the surface of the skin, called spider veins. Thigh or calf cramps (often at night) Mild swelling of feet or ankles Itching near the varicose veins Restless leg symptoms If flow of blood through the veins becomes poor enough, symptoms may include: Leg swelling Leg or calf pain after sitting or standing for long periods Skin color changes of the legs or ankles Dry, irritated, scaly skin that can crack easily Skin sores (ulcers) that do not heal easily Thickening and hardening of the skin in the legs and ankles (this can happen over time)",,Varicosity
Varnish poisoning,"Varnish is a clear liquid that is used as coating on woodwork and other products. Varnish poisoning occurs when someone swallows varnish. It is a member of a class of compounds known as hydrocarbons. Exposure to hydrocarbons, both intentional and unintentional, is a common problem, resulting in thousands of calls to poison control centers every year.",,"Below are symptoms of varnish poisoning in different parts of the body. EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT Loss of vision Severe pain in the throat Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue KIDNEYS AND BLADDER Blood in the urine Kidneys stop working ( kidney failure ) LUNGS AND AIRWAYS Breathing difficulty Throat swelling (which may also cause breathing difficulty) HEART AND BLOOD Collapse Low blood pressure that develops rapidly NERVOUS SYSTEM Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness) Dizziness Impaired memory Insomnia Irritability Loss of coordination Sensation of being drunk Severe brain damage Sleepiness Stupor (decreased level of consciousness) Walking difficulties SKIN Burns Irritation STOMACH AND INTESTINES Blood in the stool Burns in the esophagus Severe abdominal pain Vomiting Vomiting blood","Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the varnish is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. If the person swallowed the varnish, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness. If the person breathed in varnish fumes, move them to fresh air right away.",
Vascular dementia,"Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior.","Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease in people over age 65. Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes. A stroke is brain damage due to a blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood. If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage. When strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear. Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia. Risk factors for vascular dementia include: Diabetes Hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) Heart disease High blood pressure ( hypertension ) Smoking Stroke or other vascular disease Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.","Symptoms of vascular dementia may develop gradually or may progress after each small stroke. Symptoms may begin suddenly after each stroke. Some people with vascular dementia may improve for short periods, but decline after having more silent strokes. Symptoms of vascular dementia will depend on the areas of the brain that are injured due to the stroke. Early symptoms of vascular dementia can include: Difficulty performing cognitive tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills as well as behavioral changes Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior Poor performance of job duties As dementia worsens, symptoms are more obvious and the ability to take care of oneself declines. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are Having delusions, depression, or agitation Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, or violent behavior Having more difficulty reading or writing Having poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, or speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact Nervous system (neurologic) problems that occur with a stroke may also be present.",,MID; Dementia - multi-infarct; Dementia - post-stroke; Multi-infarct dementia; Cortical vascular dementia; VaD; Chronic brain syndrome - vascular; Mild cognitive impairment - vascular; MCI - vascular; Binswanger disease
Vascular ring,"Vascular ring is an abnormal formation of the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It is a congenital problem, which means it is present at birth.","Vascular ring is rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart problems. The condition occurs as often in males as females. Some infants with vascular ring also have another congenital heart problem. Vascular ring occurs very early during the baby's development in the womb. Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). The body breaks down some of the remaining arches, while others form into arteries. Some arteries that should break down do not, which forms a vascular ring. With vascular ring, some of the arches and vessels that should have changed into arteries or disappeared are still present when the baby is born. These arches form a ring of blood vessels, which encircles and presses down on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus. Several different types of vascular ring exist. In some types, the vascular ring only partially encircles the trachea and esophagus, but it still can cause symptoms.","Some children with a vascular ring never develop symptoms. However, in most cases, symptoms are seen during infancy. Pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus can lead to breathing and digestive problems. The more the ring presses down, the more severe the symptoms will be. Breathing problems may include: High-pitched cough Loud breathing (stridor) Repeated pneumonias or respiratory infections Respiratory distress Wheezing Eating may make breathing symptoms worse. Digestive symptoms are rare, but may include: Choking Difficulty eating solid foods Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Slow breast or bottle feeding Vomiting",,Right aortic arch with aberrant subclavian and left ligamentum arteriosus; Congenital heart defect - vascular ring; Birth defect heart - vascular ring

Venous insufficiency,Venous insufficiency is a condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart.,"Normally, valves in your deeper leg veins keep blood moving forward toward the heart. With long-term (chronic) venous insufficiency, vein walls are weakened and valves are damaged. This causes the veins to stay filled with blood , especially when you are standing. Chronic venous insufficiency is a long-term condition. It is most commonly due to malfunctioning (incompetent) valves in the veins. It may also occur as the result of a past blood clot in the legs.

Ventricular fibrillation,Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a severely abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that is life threatening.,"The heart pumps blood to the lungs, brain, and other organs. If the heartbeat is interrupted, even for a few seconds, it can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest. Fibrillation is an uncontrolled twitching or quivering of muscle fibers (fibrils). When it occurs in the lower chambers of the heart, it is called VF. During VF, blood is not pumped from the heart. Sudden cardiac death results. The most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. Conditions that can lead to VF include: Electrocution accidents or injury to the heart Heart attack or angina Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) Heart muscle disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and stretched or thickened Heart surgery Sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis); most often occurs in athletes who have had a sudden blow to the area directly over the heart Medicines Very high or very low potassium levels in the blood Many people with VF have no history of heart disease. However, they often have heart disease risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.",A person who has a VF episode will suddenly collapse and become unconscious.

Ventricular septal defect,Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart. Ventricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital (present from birth) heart defects. It occurs in nearly half of all children with congenital heart disease. It may occur by itself or with other congenital diseases.,"Before a baby is born, the right and left ventricles of the heart are not separate. As the fetus grows, a septum (wall) forms to separate these 2 ventricles. If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains. This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD. The hole can occur in different locations along the septal wall. There can be a single hole or multiple holes. Ventricular septal defect is a common congenital heart defect. The baby may have no symptoms and the hole can close over time as the wall continues to grow after birth. If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs. This can lead to heart failure. If the hole is small, it may not be detected for years and only discovered in adulthood. The cause of VSD is not yet known. This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects. In adults, VSDs can be rare, but serious, complication of heart attacks. These holes do not result from a birth defect.","People with VSDs may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.

It may also occur in people with: Cardiomyopathy Heart failure (also called congestive heart failure) Heart surgery Myocarditis Valvular heart disease VT can occur without other heart disease. Scar tissue may form in the muscle of the ventricles days, months, or years after a heart attack. This can lead to ventricular tachycardia. VT can also be caused by: Anti-arrhythmic drugs (used to treat an abnormal heart rhythm) Changes in blood chemistry (such as a low potassium level) Changes in blood pH (acid-base) Lack of enough oxygen ""Torsade de pointes"" is a specific form of VT. It is often due to congenital heart disease or the use of certain medicines.","You may have symptoms if the heart rate during a VT episode is very fast or lasts longer than a few seconds.

Vertebrobasilar circulatory disorders,Vertebrobasilar circulatory disorders are conditions in which the blood supply to the back of the brain is disrupted.,"In the neck, two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which enters the skull. These are the main blood vessels that provide blood flow to the back of the brain. The areas in the back of the brain that receive blood from these arteries are needed to keep a person alive. These areas regulate breathing, heart rate, swallowing, vision, movement, and posture or balance. All of the nervous system signals that connect the brain to the rest of the body pass through the back of the brain. Many different conditions may reduce or stop blood flow in the back part of the brain. The most common risk factors are smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes , increased age, and a high cholesterol level. These are similar to the risk factors for any stroke . Other causes include: Tear in the wall of an artery Blood clots in the heart that travel to the vertebral or basilar arteries and cause a stroke Blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis) Connective tissue diseases Problems in the spinal bones of the neck Outside pressure on the vertebral or basilar arteries, such as from a salon sink (nicknamed beauty parlor syndrome)","Common symptoms may include: Difficulty pronouncing words, slurred speech Difficulty swallowing Double vision or vision loss Numbness or tingling , most often on the face or scalp Sudden falls (drop attacks) Vertigo (sensation of things spinning around) Memory loss Other symptoms may include: Bladder or bowel control problems Difficulty walking (unsteady gait) Headache , neck ache Hearing loss Muscle weakness Nausea and vomiting Pain in one or more parts of the body, which gets worse with touch and cold temperatures Poor coordination Sleepiness or sleep from which the person cannot be awakened Sudden, uncoordinated movements Sweating on the face, arms, or legs",,Vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Posterior circulation ischemia; Beauty parlor syndrome; TIA - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Dizziness - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Vertigo - vertebrobasilar insufficiency

Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia,Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.,"Your body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. In order to provide vitamin B12 to your cells: You must eat foods that contain vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy products. Your body must absorb enough vitamin B12. A special protein, called intrinsic factor, helps your body do this efficiently. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. Certain health conditions can make it difficult for your body to absorb enough vitamin B12. They include: Pernicious anemia , a condition that occurs when your body destroys cells in your stomach that make intrinsic factor, which may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia Surgery that removes certain parts of your stomach or small intestine, such as some weight-loss surgeries Crohn disease , celiac disease , infection with the fish tapeworm, or other problems that make it difficult for your body to digest foods Alcohol use Taking antacids and other heartburn medicines for a long period of time Abuse of laughing gas (nitrous oxide) Long term use of the medicine metformin A lack of vitamin B12 may be due to dietary factors, including: Eating a strict vegetarian diet Poor diet in infants Poor nutrition during pregnancy","You may not have symptoms.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding of the newborn,Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn is a bleeding disorder in babies. It most often develops in the first days and weeks of life.,"A lack of vitamin K may cause severe bleeding in newborn babies. Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting. Babies often have a low level of vitamin K for a variety of reasons. Vitamin K does not move easily across the placenta from the mother to the baby. As a result, a newborn does not have much vitamin K stored up at birth. Also, the bacteria that help make vitamin K are not yet present in a newborn's gastrointestinal tract. Finally, there is not much vitamin K in mother's milk. Your baby may develop this condition if: A preventive vitamin K shot is not given at birth (if vitamin K is given by mouth instead of as a shot, it must be given more than once, and it does not appear to be as effective as the shot). The mother takes certain anti-seizure or blood-thinning drugs. The condition is grouped into three categories: Immediate-onset VKDB is very rare. It occurs within the first 48 hours after birth and is usually a result of anti-seizure medicines or some other medicines, including a blood thinner called warfarin (Coumadin), taken by mothers during pregnancy. Early-onset (formerly called “classic-onset”) disease is also rare. It occurs between 1 to 14 days after birth. It is usually seen in breastfed infants who did not receive a vitamin K shot. Late-onset VKDB is seen in infants between 2 weeks and 6 months old. It is also more likely to happen in those who did not receive a vitamin K shot. Anyone of any age with the following problems involving the gastrointestinal system is also at risk to develop this disorder: Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency Biliary atresia or other cholestatic liver disease Celiac disease Cystic fibrosis or other causes of pancreatic insufficiency Diarrhea (prolonged) Hepatitis Inflammatory bowel disease",Vitamin K deficiency causes bleeding. The most common areas of bleeding include: At the site of circumcision Belly button area Gastrointestinal tract (resulting in blood in the baby's bowel movements) Mucous membranes (such as the lining of the nose and mouth) Places where there has been a needle stick The brain There may also be: Blood in the urine Bruising Seizures (convulsions) or abnormal behavior due to bleeding inside the skull,,Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN)

Vitiligo,"Vitiligo is a skin condition in which there is a loss of color (pigment) from areas of skin. This results in uneven white patches that have no pigment, but the skin feels normal.","Vitiligo occurs when immune cells destroy the cells that make brown pigment (melanocytes). This destruction is thought to be due to an autoimmune problem. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system, which normally protects the body from infection, attacks and destroys healthy body tissue instead. The exact cause of vitiligo is unknown. Vitiligo may appear at any age. There is an increased rate of the condition in some families. Vitiligo is associated with other autoimmune diseases: Addison disease (disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones) Thyroid disease Pernicious anemia (decrease in red blood cells that occurs when the intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12) Type 1 diabetes","Flat areas of normal-feeling skin without any pigment appear suddenly or gradually. These areas have a darker border. The edges are well defined, but irregular. Vitiligo most often affects the face, elbows and knees, back of the hands and feet, and genitals. It affects both sides of the body equally. Vitiligo is more noticeable in darker-skinned people because of the contrast of white patches against dark skin.

Volkmann contracture,"Volkmann contracture is a deformity of the hand, fingers, and wrist caused by injury to the muscles of the forearm. The condition is also called Volkmann ischemic contracture.","Volkmann contracture occurs when there is a lack of blood flow (ischemia) to the forearm. This occurs when there is increased pressure due to swelling, a condition called compartment syndrome . Injury to the arm, including a crush injury or fracture, can lead to swelling that presses on blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the arm. A prolonged decrease in blood flow injures the nerves and muscles, causing them to become stiff (scarred) and shortened. When the muscle shortens, it pulls on the joint at the end of the muscle just as it would if it were normally contracted. But because it is stiff, the joint remains bent and stuck. This condition is called a contracture . In Volkmann contracture, the muscles of the forearm are severely injured. This leads to contracture deformities of the fingers, hand, and wrist. There are three levels of severity in Volkmann contracture: Mild -- contracture of 2 or 3 fingers only, with no or limited loss of feeling. Moderate -- all fingers are bent (flexed) and the thumb is stuck in the palm; the wrist may be stuck in a bent position, and there is usually loss of some feeling in the hand. Severe -- all muscles in the forearm that both flex and extend the wrist and fingers are involved; this is a severely disabling condition. There is minimal movement of the fingers and wrist. Conditions that can cause increased pressure in the forearm include: Animal bites A forearm or elbow fracture Bleeding disorders Burns Injection of certain medicines into the forearm Injury of the blood vessels in the forearm Surgery on the forearm Excessive exercise -- this would not cause severe contractures","Symptoms of Volkmann contracture affect the forearm, wrist, and hand. Symptoms may include: Decreased sensation Paleness of the skin Muscle weakness and loss ( atrophy ) Deformity of the wrist, hand, and fingers that causes the hand to have a claw-like appearance",,Ischemic contracture - Volkmann; Compartment syndrome - Volkmann ischemic contracture; Volkmann's contracture
Volvulus - childhood,A volvulus is a twisting of the intestine that can occur in childhood. It causes a blockage that may cut off blood flow. Part of the intestine may be damaged as a result.,"A birth defect called intestinal malrotation can make an infant more likely to develop a volvulus. However, a volvulus can occur without this condition present. Volvulus due to malrotation occurs most often in the first year of life.",Common symptoms of volvulus are: Bloody or dark red stools Constipation or difficulty releasing stools Distended abdomen Pain or tenderness in the abdomen Nausea or vomiting Shock Vomiting green material Symptoms are very often severe and require emergency care.

Vomiting blood,Vomiting blood is regurgitating (throwing up) contents of the stomach that contains blood.,"The upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract includes the mouth, throat, esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach and the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Blood that is vomited may come from any of these places. Vomiting that is very forceful or continues for a very long time may cause a tear in the small blood vessels of the throat. This may produce streaks of blood in the vomit. Swollen veins in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, and sometimes the stomach, may begin to bleed. These veins (called varices) may be present in people with severe liver damage. Repeated vomiting and retching may cause bleeding and damage to the lower esophagus called Mallory Weiss tears . Other causes may include: Bleeding ulcer in the stomach, first part of the small intestine, or esophagus Blood clotting disorders Defects in the blood vessels of the GI tract Swelling, irritation, or inflammation of the esophagus lining ( esophagitis ) or the stomach lining ( gastritis ) Swallowing blood (for example, after a nosebleed) Tumors of the mouth, throat, stomach or esophagus",,Get medical attention right away.

von Gierke disease,Von Gierke disease is a condition in which the body cannot break down glycogen. Glycogen is a form of sugar (glucose) that is stored in the liver and muscles. It is normally broken down into glucose to give you more energy when you need it.,"Von Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to low blood sugar . Von Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.","These are symptoms of von Gierke disease: Constant hunger and need to eat often Easy bruising and nosebleeds Fatigue Irritability Puffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly",,Type I glycogen storage disease; von Gierke's disease
Von Willebrand disease,Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder.,"Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency or poor functioning of von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor helps blood platelets clump together and stick to the blood vessel wall, which is necessary for normal blood clotting. There are several types of von Willebrand disease. A family history of a bleeding disorder is the primary risk factor.",Symptoms may include: Abnormal menstrual bleeding Bleeding of the gums Bruising Nosebleeds Skin rash Note: Most women with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding do not have von Willebrand disease.,,Bleeding disorder - von Willebrand

Vulvodynia,"Vulvodynia is a pain disorder of the vulva. This is the outside area of a woman's genitals. Vulvodynia causes severe pain, burning, and stinging of the vulva.",The exact cause of vulvodynia is unknown. Researchers are working to learn more about the condition. Causes may include: Irritation or injury to the nerves of the vulva Hormonal changes Overreaction in the cells of the vulva to infection or injury Extra nerve fibers in the vulva Weak pelvic floor muscles Allergies to certain chemicals Genetic factors that cause sensitivity or overreaction to infection or inflammation Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) do not cause this condition.,"There are two main types of vulvodynia: Localized vulvodynia. This is pain in just one area of the vulva, usually the opening of the vagina (vestibule). The pain often occurs due to pressure on the area, such as from sexual intercourse, inserting a tampon, or sitting for a long time. Generalized vulvodynia. This is pain in different areas of the vulva. The pain is fairly constant, with some periods of relief. Pressure on the vulva, such as from sitting for a long time or wearing tight pants can make symptoms worse. The vulvar pain is often: Sharp Burning Itching Throbbing You may feel symptoms all the time or just some of the time. At times, you may feel pain in the area between your vagina and anus (perineum) and in the inner thighs. Vulvodynia may occur in teens or in women. Women with vulvodynia often complain of pain during sexual activity. It may occur after having sex the first time. Or, it may occur after years of sexual activity. Certain things may trigger symptoms: Sexual intercourse Inserting a tampon Wearing tight under wear or pants Urinating Sitting for a long time Exercising or bicycling",,
Vulvovaginitis,Vulvovaginitis or vaginitis is swelling or infection of the vulva and vagina.,"INFECTIONS Yeast infections are one of the most common causes of vulvovaginitis in women. Yeast infections are most often due to the fungus Candida albicans . Candida and the many other germs that normally live in the vagina keep each other in balance. However, sometimes the number of candida organisms increase. This leads to a yeast infection. Yeast infections often cause genital itching, a thick white vaginal discharge, rash, and other symptoms. The vagina normally contains both healthy bacteria and unhealthy bacteria. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs when more unhealthy bacteria than healthy bacteria grow. BV may cause a thin, gray vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and a fishy odor. A less common type of vaginitis is spread by sexual contact. It is called trichomoniasis. Symptoms in women include genital itching, vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-gray or green in color. Women may also experience vaginal spotting after intercourse. OTHER CAUSES Chemicals can cause itchy rashes in the genital area. Spermicides and vaginal sponges , which are over-the-counter birth control methods Feminine sprays and perfumes Bubble baths and soaps Body lotions Low estrogen levels in women after menopause can cause vaginal dryness and thinning of the skin of the vagina and vulva. These factors may lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. This condition is called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), formerly known as atrophic vaginitis. Other causes include: Tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing, which leads to heat rashes. Skin conditions. Objects such as a lost tampon in your vagina can also cause irritation, itching, and strong-smelling discharge. Sometimes, the exact cause cannot be found. This is called nonspecific vulvovaginitis. It occurs in all age groups. However, it is most common in young girls before puberty, particularly girls with poor genital hygiene. It causes a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening. This condition is often linked with excess growth of bacteria that are typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the toilet. Irritated tissue is more likely to become infected than healthy tissue. Many germs that cause infection thrive in a warm, damp, and dark environment. This can also lead to a longer recovery. Sexual abuse should be considered in young girls with unusual infections and repeated episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis.","Symptoms include: Irritation and itching of the genital area Inflammation (irritation, redness, and swelling) of the genital area Vaginal discharge Foul vaginal odor Discomfort or burning when urinating",,Vaginitis; Vaginal inflammation; Inflammation of the vagina; Nonspecific vaginitis
Waardenburg syndrome,"Waardenburg syndrome is a group of conditions passed down through families. The syndrome involves deafness and pale skin, hair, and eye color.","Waardenburg syndrome is most often inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene for a child to have this condition. There are four main types of Waardenburg syndrome. The most common are type I and type II. Type III (Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) and type IV (Waardenburg-Shah syndrome) are less common. The multiple types of this syndrome result from defects in different genes. Most people with this disease have a parent with the disease, but the symptoms in the parent can be quite different from those in the child.","Symptoms may include: Cleft lip (rare) Constipation Deafness (more common in type II disease) Extremely pale blue eyes or eye colors that don't match ( heterochromia ) Pale color skin, hair, and eyes (partial albinism) Difficulty completely straightening joints Possible slight decrease in intellectual function Wide-set eyes (in type I) White patch of hair or early graying of the hair Less common types of this disease may cause problems with the arms or intestines.",,Klein-Waardenburg syndrome; Waardenburg-Shah syndrome
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a cancer of the B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). WM is associated with the overproduction of proteins called IgM antibodies.,"WM is a result of a condition called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. This is a cancer of the white blood cells, in which the B immune cells start dividing rapidly. The exact cause of too much production of the IgM antibody is unknown. Hepatitis C may increase the risk of WM. Gene mutations are often found in the malignant B cells. Production of excess IgM antibodies can cause several types of problems: Hyperviscosity, which causes the blood to become too thick. This can make it harder for blood to flow through small blood vessels. Neuropathy, or nerve damage, when the IgM antibody damages nerve tissue. Anemia , when the IgM antibody binds to red blood cells and damages them. Kidney disease, when the IgM antibody deposits in kidney tissue. Cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) when the IgM antibody forms immune complexes with cold exposure. WM is very rare. Most people with this condition are over 65 years of age.","Symptoms of WM may include any of the following: Bleeding of the gums and nosebleeds Blurred or decreased vision Bluish skin in the fingers after cold exposure Dizziness or confusion Easy bruising of the skin Fatigue Diarrhea Numbness , tingling, or burning pain in the hands, feet, fingers, toes, ears, or nose Rash Swollen glands Unintentional weight loss Vision loss in one eye",,Waldenström macroglobulinemia; Macroglobulinemia - primary; Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; Monoclonal macroglobulinemia; Waldenström macroglobulinemia
Walking abnormalities,"Walking abnormalities can be caused by many different types of problems. Problems with the joints, (such as arthritis), bones (such as deformities), circulation (such as peripheral vascular disease), or even pain can make it difficult to walk properly. Diseases or injuries to the nerves, muscles, brain, spinal cord, or inner ear can affect normal walking.","Abnormal gait may be caused by diseases in different areas of the body. General causes of abnormal gait may include: Arthritis of the spine, hip, leg, or foot joints Conversion disorder (a mental disorder) Foot problems (such as a callus, corn, ingrown toenail, wart, pain, skin sore, swelling, or spasms) Broken bone Injections into muscles that causes soreness in the leg or buttocks Infection Injury Legs that are of different lengths Inflammation or swelling of the muscles ( myositis ) Shin splints Shoe problems Inflammation or swelling of the tendons ( tendinitis ) Torsion of the testis Brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve diseases Vision problems Inner ear problems This list does not include all causes of abnormal gait. CAUSES OF SPECIFIC GAITS Propulsive gait: Carbon monoxide poisoning Manganese poisoning Parkinson disease Use of certain drugs, including phenothiazines, haloperidol, thiothixene, loxapine, and metoclopramide (usually, drug effects are temporary) Spastic or scissoring gait: Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus Brain abscess Brain or head trauma Brain tumor Stroke Cerebral palsy Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy (a problem with the vertebrae in the neck) Infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, and others Liver failure Multiple sclerosis (MS) Spinal cord trauma Spinal cord tumor Neurosyphilis (bacterial infection of the brain or spinal cord due to syphilis) Syringomyelia (collection of cerebrospinal fluid that forms in the spinal cord) Vitamin or mineral deficiency (low Vitamin B12, Vitamin E, or copper levels) Steppage gait: Neuropathy such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and hereditary neuropathy Herniated lumbar disk Multiple sclerosis Muscle weakness of the tibia Peroneal neuropathy Polio Spinal cord injury Muscle diseases The conditions that cause spastic or scissoring gait can also cause steppage gait. Waddling gait: Congenital hip dysplasia Muscular dystrophy (group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue) Muscle disease (myopathy) Spinal muscle atrophy Ataxic, or broad-based, gait: Cerebellar ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movement due to disease or injury to the cerebellum in the brain) Chiari or other malformation Alcohol intoxication Brain injury Progressive damage to nerve cells in the cerebellum of the brain (cerebellar degeneration) Medicines (phenytoin and other anti-seizure medicines) Polyneuropathy (damage to many nerves, as occurs with diabetes) Stroke or bleeding in the cerebellum Magnetic gait: Disorders that affect the front part of the brain Hydrocephalus (increased fluid in the brain)",,"Treating the underlying cause often improves the gait. For example, gait abnormalities from trauma to part of the leg will improve as the leg heals. Physical therapy almost always helps with short-term or long-term gait disorders. Therapy will reduce the risk for falls and other injuries. For an abnormal gait that occurs with conversion disorder, counseling and support from family members are strongly recommended. For any gait problem that is likely to be long term, reduce fall risk by modifying one's surroundings. Keep pathways well-lit and free of clutter like wires and other hazards. Remove loose rugs and install grab bars or railings. For a propulsive gait: Encourage the person to be as independent as possible. Allow plenty of time for daily activities, especially walking. People with this problem are likely to fall because they have poor balance and are always trying to catch up. Provide walking assistance for safety reasons, especially on uneven ground. See a physical therapist for exercise therapy and walking retraining. For a scissoring or spastic gait: People with a scissoring gait often lose skin sensation. Skin care should be used to avoid skin sores. Leg braces and in-shoe splints can help keep the foot in the right position for standing and walking. A physical therapist can supply these and provide exercise therapy, if needed. Exercises are encouraged. A cane or a walker is recommended for those with poor balance. Medicines (muscle relaxers, anti-spasticity medicines) can reduce the muscle overactivity. For a steppage gait: Get enough rest. Fatigue can often cause a person to stub a toe and fall. Leg braces or orthoses and in-shoe splints can help keep the foot in the best position for standing and walking. A physical therapist can supply these and provide exercise therapy, if needed. For some, a high-top boot may be sufficient. For a waddling gait, follow the treatment your health care provider prescribed. Bracing, canes and walkers can be of help. For a magnetic gait due to hydrocephalus, walking may improve after the excess fluid is treated.",Gait abnormalities

You may need to go to the hospital if the reaction is severe. If you have an allergy to wasp, bee, hornet or yellow jacket stings, always carry a bee sting kit and know how to use it. These kits require a prescription. They contain a medicine called epinephrine, which you should take right away if you get a wasp sting. To treat the wasp sting: Try to remove the stinger from the skin (if it is still present). To do this, carefully scrape the back of a knife or other thin, blunt, straight-edged object (like a credit card) across the stinger if the person can keep still and it is safe to do so. Or, you can pull out the stinger with tweezers or your fingers. If you do this, do not pinch the venom sac at the end of the stinger. If this sac is broken, more venom will be released. Clean the area thoroughly with soap and water. Place ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the person has problems with blood circulation, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage. Keep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. Loosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry. Give the person diphenhydramine (Benadryl and other brands) by mouth if they can swallow. This antihistamine drug may be used alone for mild symptoms.",

West Nile virus infection,West Nile virus causes a viral disease and is spread by mosquitoes. The condition ranges from mild to severe.,"West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda in eastern Africa. It was first discovered in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York. Since then, the virus has spread throughout the US. Researchers believe West Nile virus is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a person. Mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of the virus in the late summer and early fall, which is why more people get the disease in late August to early September. As the weather becomes colder and mosquitoes die off, there are fewer cases of the disease. Although many people are bitten by mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus, most do not know they have been infected. Risk factors for developing a more severe form of West Nile virus include: Conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS , organ transplants, and recent chemotherapy Older or very young age Pregnancy West Nile virus may also be spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. It is possible for an infected mother to spread the virus to her child through breast milk.","Symptoms may occur 1 to 14 days after becoming infected. Mild disease, generally called West Nile fever, may cause some or all of the following symptoms: Abdominal pain Fever, headache, and sore throat Lack of appetite Muscle aches Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Rash Swollen lymph nodes These symptoms usually last for 3 to 6 days, but may last a month.

Williams syndrome,Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development.,"Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of 25 to 27 genes on chromosome number 7. In most cases, the gene changes occur on their own, either in the sperm or egg that a baby develops from. However, once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it. One of the missing genes is the gene that produces elastin. This is a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition.","Symptoms of Williams syndrome are: Feeding problems, including colic, reflux , and vomiting Inward bend of the small finger Sunken chest Heart disease or blood vessel problems Developmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, learning disorders Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing Easily distracted, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music Short height, compared to the rest of the person's biologic relatives The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show: A flattened nasal bridge with small, upturned nose Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip Prominent lips with an open mouth Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth",,Williams-Beuren syndrome; WBS; Beuren syndrome; 7q11.23 deletion syndrome; Elfin facies syndrome

Wilson disease,Wilson disease is an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues. The excess copper damages the liver and nervous system.,"Wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder. If both parents carry a non-working (variant) gene for Wilson disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder. Wilson disease causes the body to take in and keep too much copper. The copper deposits in the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. This causes tissue damage, tissue death, and scarring. The affected organs stop working normally. This condition is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but it may occur in any group. Wilson disease symptoms typically appear in people under 40 years old. Damage to the liver may begin in children by age 6, but clinical symptoms most often appear in people in their teens or early twenties.","Symptoms may include: Abnormal posture of arms and legs Arthritis Confusion or delirium Dementia Difficulty moving arms and legs, stiffness Difficulty walking (ataxia) Emotional or behavioral changes Enlargement of the abdomen due to accumulation of fluid (ascites) Personality changes Phobias Slow movements Slow or decreased movement and expressions of the face Speech impairment Tremors of the arms or hands Uncontrollable movement Unpredictable and jerky movement Vomiting blood Weakness Yellow skin (jaundice) or yellow color of the white of the eye (icterus)",,Wilson's disease; Hepatolenticular degeneration

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW),Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a condition in which there is an extra electrical pathway in the heart that leads to periods of rapid heart rate (tachycardia).,"Normally, electrical signals follow a certain pathway through the heart. This helps the heart beat regularly. This prevents the heart from having extra beats or beats happening too soon. In people with WPW syndrome, some of the heart's electrical signals go down an extra pathway. This may cause a very rapid heart rate called supraventricular tachycardia. Most people with WPW syndrome do not have any other heart problems. However, this condition has been linked with other cardiac conditions, such as Ebstein anomaly . A form of the condition also runs in families.","How often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some people with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so that condition is found when a heart test is done for another reason.

This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.,,,,Wrist surgery; Arthroscopy - wrist; Surgery - wrist - arthroscopy; Surgery - wrist - arthroscopic; Carpal tunnel release
Wrist pain,Wrist pain is any pain or discomfort in the wrist.,"Carpal tunnel syndrome: A common cause of wrist pain is carpal tunnel syndrome . The carpal tunnel is an area in your wrist that is created by wrist bones and which contains the median nerve and tendons. You may feel aching, burning, numbness, or tingling in your palm, wrist, thumb, or fingers. The thumb muscle can become weak, making it difficult to grasp things. Pain may go up to your elbow. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve gets compressed at the wrist because of swelling of structures in the carpal tunnel or narrowing due to the bones of the carpal tunnel. This is the nerve in the wrist that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Swelling can occur if you: Do repetitive movements with your wrist, such as typing on a computer keyboard, using a computer mouse, playing racquetball or handball, sewing, painting, writing, or using a vibrating tool Are pregnant, menopausal, or overweight Have diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, an underactive thyroid, or rheumatoid arthritis Injury: Wrist pain with bruising and swelling is often a sign of an injury. Signs of a possible broken bone include deformed joints and inability to move the wrist, hand, or a finger. There can also be cartilage injuries in the wrist. Other common injuries include sprain , strain , tendinitis , and bursitis . Arthritis: Arthritis is another common cause of wrist pain, swelling, and stiffness. There are many types of arthritis: Osteoarthritis occurs with age and overuse. Rheumatoid arthritis generally affects both wrists. Psoriatic arthritis usually accompanies psoriasis. Infectious arthritis is a medical emergency. Signs of an infection include redness and warmth of the wrist, fever above 100°F (37.7°C), and recent illness. Other Causes Gout : This occurs when your body produces too much uric acid, a waste product. The uric acid forms crystals in the joints, rather than being excreted in the urine. Pseudogout : This occurs when calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposit in the joints, causing pain, redness, and swelling. The wrists and knees are most often affected.",,"For carpal tunnel syndrome, you may need to make adjustments to your work habits and environment: Make sure that your keyboard is low enough that your wrists are not bending upward while you type. Take plenty of breaks from activities that aggravate the pain. When typing, stop often to rest the hands, if only for a moment. Rest your hands on their sides, not the wrists. An occupational therapist can show you ways to ease pain and swelling and stop the syndrome from coming back. Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen can relieve pain and swelling. Various typing pads, split keyboards, and wrist splints (braces) are designed to relieve wrist pain. These may help symptoms. Try a few different kinds to see if any of them help. You may only need to wear a wrist splint at night while you sleep. This helps reduce the swelling. If this does not help, you may need to wear the splint during the day as well. Apply warm or cold compresses a few times during the day. For a recent injury: Rest your wrist. Keep it elevated above the heart level to reduce any swelling. Apply an ice pack to the tender and swollen area. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Apply the ice for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day and every 3 to 4 hours after that. Take over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen. Follow package instructions on how much to take. DO NOT take more than the recommended amount. Ask your health care provider if it's OK to wear a splint for several days. Wrist splints can be purchased at many drugstores and medical supply stores. For non-infectious arthritis: Do flexibility and strengthening exercises every day. Work with an occupational
   therapist to learn the best and safest exercises for your wrist. Try the exercises after a hot bath or shower so that your wrist is warmed up and less stiff. DO NOT do exercise when your wrist is inflamed. Make sure that you also rest the joint.

Xeroderma pigmentosum,Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare condition passed down through families. XP causes the skin and tissue covering the eye to be extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Some people also develop nervous system problems.,"XP is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder . This means you must have 2 copies of an abnormal gene in order for the disease or trait to develop. The disorder is inherited from both your mother and father at the same time. The abnormal gene is rare, so the chances of both parents having the gene are very rare. For this reason, it is unlikely for somebody with the condition to pass it on to the next generation, although it is possible. UV light, such as from sunlight, damages the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells. Normally, the body repairs this damage. But in people with XP, the body does not fix the damage. As a result, the skin gets very thin and patches of varying color (splotchy pigmentation) appear.","Symptoms usually appear by the time a child is 2 years old. Skin symptoms include: Sunburn that does not heal after just a little bit of sun exposure Blistering after just a little bit of sun exposure Spider-like blood vessels under the skin Patches of discolored skin that get worse, resembling severe aging Crusting of the skin Scaling of the skin Oozing raw skin surface Discomfort when being in bright light ( photophobia ) Skin cancer at a very young age (including melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma ) Eye symptoms include: Dry eye Clouding of the cornea Ulcers of the cornea Swelling or inflammation of the eyelids Cancer of eyelids, cornea or sclera Nervous system (neurologic) symptoms, which develop in some children, include: Intellectual disability Delayed growth Loss of hearing Muscle weakness of the legs and arms",,

Yaws mainly affects children in rural, warm, tropical areas, such as, Africa, Western Pacific islands, and Southeast Asia. Yaws is transmitted by direct contact with the skin sores of infected people.","About 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the person develops a sore called a ""mother yaw"" where bacteria enter the skin. The sore may be tan or reddish and looks like a raspberry. It is most often painless, but does cause itching. The sores may last for months. More sores may appear shortly before or after the mother yaw heals. Scratching the sore can spread the bacteria from the mother yaw to uninfected skin. Eventually, the skin sores heal. Other symptoms include: Bone pain Scarring of the skin Swelling of the bones and fingers In the advanced stage, sores on the skin and bones can lead to severe disfigurement and disability.

Zika virus disease,"Zika is a virus passed to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, joint pain, rash, and red eyes (conjunctivitis).","The Zika virus is named after the Zika forest in Uganda, where the virus was first discovered in 1947. HOW ZIKA CAN SPREAD Mosquitoes spread the Zika virus from person to person. Mosquitoes acquire the virus when they feed on infected people. They then spread the virus when they bite other people. The mosquitoes that spread Zika are the same type that spread dengue fever and chikungunya virus . These mosquitoes usually feed during the day. Zika can be passed from a mother to her baby. This can happen in the uterus or at the time of birth. Zika has not been found to spread through breastfeeding. The virus can be spread through sex. People with Zika can spread the disease to their sex partners before symptoms begin, while they have symptoms, or even after symptoms end. The virus can also be passed during sex by people with Zika who never develop symptoms. No one knows how long Zika remains in sperm and vaginal fluids, or how long it can be spread during sex. The virus remains in semen longer than in other body fluids (blood, urine, vaginal fluids). Zika can also be spread through: Blood transfusion Exposure in a laboratory WHERE ZIKA IS FOUND Before 2015, the virus was found mainly in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. In May 2015, the virus was discovered for the first time in Brazil. It spread to many territories, states, and countries in: Caribbean Islands Central America Mexico South America Pacific Islands Africa The virus was confirmed in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and United States Virgin Islands. The disease has been found in travelers coming to the United States from affected areas. Cases in the US have been diagnosed in Florida and Texas. Since 2019, there have been no confirmed Zika virus disease cases reported in the United States. To find the most up-to-date information on area where Zika may be found, please see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) page Zika Travel Information .","Only about 1 in 5 people infected with Zika virus will have symptoms. This means that you can have Zika and not know it. Symptoms tend to occur 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. They include: Fever Rash Joint pain Red eyes (conjunctivitis) Muscle pain Headache Symptoms are usually mild, and last for a few days to a week before going away entirely.",,Zika virus infection; Zika virus; Zika
